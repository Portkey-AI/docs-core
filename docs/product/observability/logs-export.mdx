At Portkey, we understand the importance of data analysis and reporting for businesses and teams. That's why we provide a comprehensive logs export feature for our paid users. With this feature, you can easily request and obtain your Portkey logs data in a **structured JSON** format, allowing you to gain valuable insights into your LLM usage, performance, costs, and more.

## Requesting Logs Export

To submit a data export request, simply follow these steps:

1. Ensure you are an admin of your organization on Portkey.
2. Send an email to [support@portkey.ai](mailto:support@portkey.ai) with the subject line `Logs Export - [Your_Organization_Name]`.
3. In the email body,
   * Specify the **time frame** for which you require the logs data. **Pro plan** supports logs export of **last 30** days.
   * Share names of the **specific columns** you require (see the "[Exported Data](/docs/product/observability/logs-export#exported-data)" section below for a complete list of available columns).
4. Our team will process your request and provide you with the exported logs data in JSON format.

<Note>
   Note: Portkey only supports data exports in the **`JSONL`** format, and can not process exports in any other formats at the moment.
