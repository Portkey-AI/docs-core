## Integration

Portkey works out of the box with Strands Agents and supports all of Portkey + Strands functionalities because of our end-to-end support for the OpenAI API. You can directly import the OpenAI Model class inside Strands, set the base URL to Portkey Gateway URL, and unlock all of Portkey functionalities. Here's how:

### Portkey Setup

First, let's setup your provider keys and settings on Portkey, that you can later use in Strands with your Portkey API key.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create Provider">
Go to [Virtual Keys](https://app.portkey.ai/virtual-keys) in the Portkey App to add your AI provider key and copy the virtual key ID.
</Step>

<Step title="Create Config">
Go to [Configs](https://app.portkey.ai/configs) in the Portkey App, create a new config that uses your virtual key, then save the Config ID.
</Step>

<Step title="Create API Key">
Go to [API Keys](https://app.portkey.ai/api-keys) in the Portkey App to generate a new API key and attach your Config as the default routing.
</Step>
</Steps>

That's it! With this, you unlock all Portkey functionalities for use with your Strands Agents!

### Strands Setup

Now, let's setup Strands Agents to use the Portkey API key we just created.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install Packages">
```bash
pip install -U strands-agents strands-agents-tools openai portkey-ai
```
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Portkey Client">

When you instantiate the `OpenAIModel`, set the `base_url` to Portkey's Gateway URL and pass your Portkey API Key directly in as the main API key.
```python
from strands.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from portkey_ai import PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL

portkey_model = OpenAIModel(
    client_args={
        "api_key": "YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        "base_url": PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL
    },
    model_id="gpt-4o",
    params={
        "temperature": 0.7
    }
)
```

That's it! With this, you unlock all Portkey functionalities to be used along with your Strands Agents!
</Step>
<Step title="View the Log">
Portkey logs all of your Strands requests in the [Logs dashboard](https://app.portkey.ai/logs).
<Frame><img src="PATH_TO_PLACEHOLDER" alt="Portkey Logs screenshot"/></Frame>
</Step>
</Steps>

## End-to-end Example

```python
from strands import Agent
from strands.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from strands_tools import calculator
from portkey_ai import PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL

model = OpenAIModel(
    client_args={
        "api_key": "YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        "base_url": PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL
    },
    model_id="gpt-4o",
    params={
        "max_tokens": 1000,
        "temperature": 0.7,
    }
)

agent = Agent(model=model, tools=[calculator])
response = agent("What is 2+2")
print(response)
```

We've demonstrated a simple working integration between Portkey & Strands. Check below for all the advanced functionalities Portkey offers for your Strands Agents.

## Production Features

### 1. Enhanced Observability

Portkey provides comprehensive observability for your Strands agents, helping you understand exactly what's happening during each execution.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Traces">
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/product/product-11-1.webp"/>
</Frame>

Traces provide a hierarchical view of your agent's execution, showing the sequence of LLM calls, tool invocations, and state transitions.

```python {10}
from strands import Agent
from strands.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from strands_tools import calculator
from portkey_ai import PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,createHeaders

model = OpenAIModel(
    client_args={
        "api_key": "YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        "base_url": PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
        "default_headers":createHeaders(trace_id="strands")
    },
    model_id="gpt-4o",
    params={
        "max_tokens": 1000,
        "temperature": 0.7,
    }
)

agent = Agent(model=model, tools=[calculator])
response = agent("What is 2+2")
print(response)
```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Logs">
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/product/product-2.avif"/>
</Frame>

Portkey logs every interaction with LLMs, including:

- Complete request and response payloads
- Latency and token usage metrics
- Cost calculations
- Tool calls and function executions

All logs can be filtered by metadata, trace IDs, models, and more, making it easy to debug specific agent runs.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Metrics & Dashboards">
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/product/dashboard.png"/>
</Frame>

Portkey provides built-in dashboards that help you:

- Track cost and token usage across all agent runs
- Analyze performance metrics like latency and success rates
- Identify bottlenecks in your agent workflows
- Compare different agent configurations and LLMs

You can filter and segment all metrics by custom metadata to analyze specific agent types, user groups, or use cases.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Metadata Filtering">
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/metadata.png" alt="Analytics with metadata filters" />
</Frame>

Add custom metadata to your Strands calls to enable powerful filtering and segmentation:

```python
from strands import Agent
from strands.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from strands_tools import calculator
from portkey_ai import PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,createHeaders

model = OpenAIModel(
    client_args={
        "api_key": "YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        "base_url": PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
        "default_headers":createHeaders(
            trace_id="strands",
            metadata={
                "agent_type": "strands_agent",
                "environment": "production",
                "_user": "user_123",
                "request_source": "mobile_app"
            }
        )
    },
    model_id="gpt-4o",
    params={
        "max_tokens": 1000,
        "temperature": 0.7,
    }
)

agent = Agent(model=model, tools=[calculator])
response = agent("What is 2+2")
print(response)
```

This metadata can be used to filter logs, traces, and metrics on the Portkey dashboard, allowing you to analyze specific agent runs, users, or environments.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Reliability - Keep Your Agents Running Smoothly

When running agents in production, things can go wrong - API rate limits, network issues, or provider outages. Portkey's reliability features ensure your agents keep running smoothly even when problems occur.

It's simple to enable fallback in your Strands Agents by using a Portkey Config that you can attach at runtime or directly to your Portkey API key. Here's an example of attaching a Config at runtime:

```python {11-20}
from strands import Agent
from strands.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from strands_tools import calculator
from portkey_ai import PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,createHeaders

model = OpenAIModel(
    client_args={
        "api_key": "YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        "base_url": PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
        "default_headers":createHeaders(
            config={
                "strategy": {
                    "mode": "fallback",
                    "on_status_codes": [429]
                },
                "targets": [
                    { "virtual_key": "azure-81fddb" },
                    { "virtual_key": "open-ai-key-66a67d" }
                ]
            }
        )
    },
    model_id="gpt-4o",
    params={
        "max_tokens": 1000,
        "temperature": 0.7,
    }
)

agent = Agent(model=model, tools=[calculator])
response = agent("What is 2+2")
print(response)
```

This configuration will automatically try GPT-4o on OpenAI if the Azure deployment fails, ensuring your agent can continue operating.

### 3. Guardrails for Safe Agents

Guardrails ensure your Strands agents operate safely and respond appropriately in all situations.

**Why Use Guardrails?**

Strands agents can experience various failure modes:
- Generating harmful or inappropriate content
- Leaking sensitive information like PII
- Hallucinating incorrect information
- Generating outputs in incorrect formats

Portkey's guardrails can:
- Detect and redact PII in both inputs and outputs
- Filter harmful or inappropriate content
- Validate response formats against schemas
- Check for hallucinations against ground truth
- Apply custom business logic and rules

### 4. Model Interoperability

Strands supports multiple LLM providers, and Portkey extends this capability by providing access to over 200 LLMs through a unified interface. You can easily switch between different models without changing your core agent logic:

```python
from strands import Agent
from strands.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from strands_tools import calculator
from portkey_ai import PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,createHeaders

model = OpenAIModel(
    client_args={
        "api_key": "YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        "base_url": PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
        "default_headers":createHeaders(
            provider="anthropic",
            api_key="ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
        )
    },
    model_id="claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
    params={
        "max_tokens": 1000,
        "temperature": 0.7,
    }
)

agent = Agent(model=model, tools=[calculator])
response = agent("What is 2+2")
print(response)
```

Portkey provides access to LLMs from providers including:

- OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, etc.)
- Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, etc.)
- Mistral AI (Mistral Large, Mistral Medium, etc.)
- Google Vertex AI (Gemini 1.5 Pro, etc.)
- Cohere (Command, Command-R, etc.)
- AWS Bedrock (Claude, Titan, etc.)
- Local/Private Models
