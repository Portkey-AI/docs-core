Portkey provides a robust and secure gateway to facilitate the integration of various Large Language Models (LLMs) into your applications, including [Snowlfake Cortex APIs](https://docs.snowflake.com/).

With Portkey, you can take advantage of features like fast AI gateway access, observability, prompt management, and more, all while ensuring the secure management of your LLM API keys through a [virtual key](/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys) system.

## Portkey SDK Integration with Snowflake Cortex Models

Portkey provides a consistent API to interact with models from various providers. To integrate Snowflake Cortex with Portkey:

### 1\. Install the Portkey SDK

Add the Portkey SDK to your application to interact with Snowflake Cortex AI's API through Portkey's gateway.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS">
        ```sh
        npm install --save portkey-ai
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python">
        ```sh
        pip install portkey-ai
        ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>




### 2\. Initialize Portkey with the Virtual Key

To use Snowflake Cortex with Portkey, get your API key/JWT Token from the Snowflake Platform, then add it to Portkey to create the virtual key.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">

```js
import Portkey from 'portkey-ai'

const portkey = new Portkey({
    apiKey: "PORTKEY_API_KEY", // defaults to process.env["PORTKEY_API_KEY"]
    virtualKey: "VIRTUAL_KEY" // Your Snowflake Cortex Virtual Key
})
```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python SDK">
        ```python
        from portkey_ai import Portkey

        portkey = Portkey(
            api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",  # Replace with your Portkey API key
            virtual_key="VIRTUAL_KEY"   # Replace with your virtual key for Snowflake Cortex
        )
        ```

    </Tab>

  </Tabs>



### **3\. Invoke Chat Completions with** Snowflake Cortex

Use the Portkey instance to send requests to Snowflake Cortex. You can also override the virtual key directly in the API call if needed.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">

        ```js
const chatCompletion = await portkey.chat.completions.create({
            messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],
            model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet',
        });

        console.log(chatCompletion.choices);
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python SDK">

```python
completion = portkey.chat.completions.create(
    messages= [{ "role": 'user', "content": 'Say this is a test' }],
    model= 'claude-3-5-sonnet'
)

print(completion)
```

    </Tab>

  </Tabs>


## Managing Snowflake Cortex Prompts

You can manage all prompts to Snowflake Cortex in the [Prompt Library](/product/prompt-library). All the current models of Snowflake Cortex are supported and you can easily start testing different prompts.

Once you're ready with your prompt, you can use the `portkey.prompts.completions.create` interface to use the prompt in your application.
