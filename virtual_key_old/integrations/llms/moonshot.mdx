Portkey provides a robust and secure gateway to facilitate the integration of various Large Language Models (LLMs) into your applications, including [Moonshot. ](https://moonshot.cn)

With Portkey, you can take advantage of features like fast AI gateway access, observability, prompt management, and more, all while ensuring the secure management of your LLM API keys through a [virtual key](/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys) system.

## Portkey SDK Integration with Moonshot Models

Portkey provides a consistent API to interact with models from various providers. To integrate Moonshot with Portkey:

### 1\. Install the Portkey SDK

Add the Portkey SDK to your application to interact with Moonshot's API through Portkey's gateway.
<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS">
        ```sh
        npm install --save portkey-ai
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python">

```sh
pip install portkey-ai
```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>



### 2\. Initialize Portkey with the Virtual Key

To use Moonshot with Portkey, [get your API key from here,](https://moonshot.cn) then add it to Portkey to create the virtual key.
<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">
        ```js
import Portkey from 'portkey-ai'

const portkey = new Portkey({
            apiKey: "PORTKEY_API_KEY", // defaults to process.env["PORTKEY_API_KEY"]
            virtualKey: "VIRTUAL_KEY" // Your Moonshot Virtual Key
        })
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python SDK">
        ```python
        from portkey_ai import Portkey

        portkey = Portkey(
            api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",  # Replace with your Portkey API key
            virtual_key="VIRTUAL_KEY"   # Replace with your virtual key for Groq
        )
        ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>



### 3\. Invoke Chat Completions with Moonshot

Use the Portkey instance to send requests to Moonshot. You can also override the virtual key directly in the API call if needed.
<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">
        ```js
const chatCompletion = await portkey.chat.completions.create({
            messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],
            model: 'moonshot-v1-8k',
        });

        console.log(chatCompletion.choices);d
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python SDK">
        ```python
        completion = portkey.chat.completions.create(
            messages= [{ "role": 'user', "content": 'Say this is a test' }],
            model= 'moonshot-v1-8k'
        )

        print(completion)
        ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>


## Managing Moonshot Prompts

You can manage all prompts to Moonshot in the [Prompt Library](/product/prompt-library). All the current models of Moonshot are supported and you can easily start testing different prompts.

Once you're ready with your prompt, you can use the `portkey.prompts.completions.create` interface to use the prompt in your application.

The complete list of features supported in the SDK are available on the link below.
