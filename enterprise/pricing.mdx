#### 2. Production Gateway Deployments
<Info>
*Only relevant for Hybrid and Air-gapped deployments.*
</Info>

This lever allows you to align costs with the breadth of your implementation.


Your base enterprise license includes **one (1) production gateway deployment**. You can add more licenses for additional deployments, such as for different business units, cloud providers, or geographic regions.


| Scenario                             | Licences required        |
| :------------------------------------ | :------------------------ |
| Single cloud / single region         | 1                        |
| Multi‑cloud (AWS + Azure)            | 2                        |
| Separate BU with own budgets         | 1 per BU                 |
| Disaster‑recovery region hot‑standby | 1 (counts as production) |

Unlimited dev/staging gateways are always included at no cost. You can also scale up or out — unlimited horizontal and vertical scaling is available for every deployment.

**Additional Production Deployments:** Each additional production gateway is charged separately

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What Qualifies as a Separate Production Deployment?">
    • Multi-cloud deployments (AWS + Azure + GCP) <br />
    • Geographic distribution (US + EU + APAC) <br />
    • Isolated business unit deployments <br />
    • Dedicated customer environments <br />
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Development & Staging Environments">
    • Unlimited dev/staging gateways on each license <br />
    • No additional charges for non-production use <br />
    • Full feature parity with production <br />
