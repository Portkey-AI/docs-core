## Severity Definition

We classify incidents into four severities. Use these as your quick-glance guide:

<Steps>
  <Step title="SEV 1">
    Production down or severely degraded; no viable workaround; immediate business impact.
  </Step>
  <Step title="SEV 2">
    Major functionality impaired; workaround exists; significant performance or usability impact.
  </Step>
  <Step title="SEV 3">
    Minor functionality issue; workaround available; or development/test environment affected.
  </Step>
  <Step title="SEV 4">
    General questions, documentation clarifications, or enhancement requests.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## SLAs

#### Initial Response & Update Targets

<Note>
`Initial Response` means your ticket is acknowledged by a support engineer.

`Updates` are progress communications until a workaround or fix is delivered.
</Note>

| :-- | :-- | :-- |

2.  System **opens a Sev 1 ticket**, posts an incident room link, and **pages engineering**.
3.  First engineer **joins the bridge within 15 minutes**.
4.  Incident comms cadence: **every 1 hour** until mitigated.

<Note> 
This feature is reserved strictly for SEV 1 events.
</Note>

## Case Lifecycle

2. `Triage` – Severity confirmed; SLA clock starts.
3. `Investigate` – Logs, telemetry, and configuration collected.
4. `Mitigate` – Workaround or fix provided.
5. `Close` – Ticket closed with RCA.
6. `(Premium) Post‑Incident Review` – RCA call within 5 business days.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does Premium Support include professional services for custom development or integrations?">

Please discuss specific needs with your sales representative.
  </Accordion>

    Upon subscribing to a support tier, you'll designate your named contacts. For Premium, these contacts will be onboarded to any special communication channels like the shared Slack. Changes to named contacts can be requested through the support portal or your account manager.
  </Accordion>
