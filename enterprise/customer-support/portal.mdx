## Getting Started

### For Admins: Setting Up Your Team

If you're the designated Admin for your organization, here's how to get your team up and running:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to the portal">
    Go to [support.portkey.ai](https://support.portkey.ai) and enter your email. You'll receive a one-time passcode (OTP) — check your inbox and enter it to log in. No password needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your team members">
    Go to the **Members** tab → Click **Add Member** → Enter their email and assign a role.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bookmark useful links">
    - [support.portkey.ai](https://support.portkey.ai) — Support Portal
    - [status.portkey.ai](https://status.portkey.ai) — Service Status
    - [docs.portkey.ai](https://docs.portkey.ai) — Documentation
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Deciding who should be Admin vs Member?**
- **Admins** can view all tickets across your organization and manage team access. Best for: Team leads, Engineering managers, DevOps leads.
- **Members** can only view and manage their own tickets. Best for: Individual developers, Support contacts.

We recommend having **at least 2 Admins** for redundancy.

### What to Include in Your Ticket

The more context you provide, the faster we can help. Include:

| Information | Why It Helps |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Clear description** | What's happening vs. what you expected |
| **Steps to reproduce** | How can we recreate the issue? |
| **Timestamps + timezone** | When did this occur? |
| **Trace IDs / Request IDs** | Find these in your [Portkey logs](/product/observability/logs) |
| **Error messages** | Exact error text or screenshots |
| **Code snippets** | Relevant code causing the issue |
| **Environment details** | SDK version, language, dev/staging/production |
| **Impact scope** | How many users or requests are affected? |

<Warning>
**Redact sensitive data** — Never include API keys, passwords, secrets, or PII in tickets. Use trace IDs instead of full request bodies.
</Warning>

### CC'ing Team Members

To loop in teammates on a ticket:
- Reply to the ticket email with them CC'd

All CC'd members will receive updates on that ticket.
