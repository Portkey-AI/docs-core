</Info>

## Quick Start for New Customers

Just procured Portkey? Here's what to do first:

1. **Log in:** Go to [support.portkey.ai](https://support.portkey.ai) and enter your email
2. **Check your inbox** for a one-time passcode (OTP) - expires after 10 minutes
3. **Add your team:** Go to Members tab → Add Member to give your team access
4. **Create your first ticket:** Go to Issues tab → Create Ticket
5. **Bookmark useful links:** [status.portkey.ai](https://status.portkey.ai) and [docs.portkey.ai](https://docs.portkey.ai)

No account creation needed - your access is automatically tied to your organization's Enterprise subscription.

## If You're Not an Admin

**As a Member, you can:**
- Create and submit tickets
- View and reply to your own tickets
- Attach files and add context to your issues
- Track status and get email notifications

**You cannot:**
- View other team members' tickets
- Add or remove team members
- Change access roles

Need admin access? Ask your organization's admin to update your role in the Members tab.

## Troubleshooting Login

**Can't log in? Common fixes:**

- **Not receiving OTP?** Check spam folder - email comes from support.portkey.ai
- **OTP expired?** Request a new one - they expire after 10 minutes
- **Wrong email?** Use the email associated with your Portkey account
- **No access?** Contact [support@portkey.ai](mailto:support@portkey.ai) or ask your admin to add you
- **Multiple workspaces?** Select the correct organization after logging in

We'll help you bulk provision access.
