<Note>
**Premium Support Only** — Shared Slack channels are available exclusively to Portkey Premium Support customers. [Contact sales](mailto:sales@portkey.ai) to upgrade your support tier.
</Note>

Your shared Slack channel with Portkey provides the fastest, most conversational way to get support. Every thread you start becomes a trackable ticket that syncs with the portal and email.

---

## Getting Started

### How Slack Support Works

When you have Premium Support, Portkey sets up a dedicated **Slack Connect channel** between your workspace and ours. This gives you:

- **Direct access** to Portkey support engineers
- **Real-time conversations** without switching context
- **Automatic ticket creation** — every thread becomes a trackable ticket
- **Full sync** — everything appears in the support portal too

### Channel Setup

Your shared Slack channel is provisioned during onboarding:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Kickoff Call" icon="phone">
    During your Premium Support kickoff, we'll gather your Slack workspace details
  </Step>
  <Step title="Channel Created" icon="hashtag">
    We create a Slack Connect channel (typically named #portkey-support)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Team Invited" icon="users">
    Your designated contacts are added to the channel
  </Step>
  <Step title="Panic Button Pinned" icon="siren">
    The Panic Button URL is pinned for SEV 1 emergencies
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Can't find your shared channel? Check with your Account Manager or email [support@portkey.ai](mailto:support@portkey.ai).
</Tip>

### Who Can Access

- **Your team** — Named contacts designated during setup
- **Portkey team** — Support engineers and your Account Manager
- **Adding members** — Contact your Account Manager to add more team members

## Creating Support Requests

### Starting a New Thread

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Your Shared Channel" icon="hashtag">
    Open your #portkey-support (or similar) Slack channel
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start a New Thread" icon="message">
    Post a new message describing your issue — this creates a ticket automatically
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Details in Thread" icon="comments">
    Add additional context, screenshots, and files as thread replies
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Response" icon="clock">
    Our team is notified and will respond based on your SLA
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Always start a new thread for new issues.** Don't reply to old threads with new problems — each issue should have its own thread for proper tracking.
</Warning>

</Frame>

### Information to Include

The more context you provide, the faster we can help. Include as much of the following as possible:

| Include | Why It Helps |
|---------|--------------|
| **Clear description** | What's happening vs. what you expected |
| **Steps to reproduce** | How can we recreate the issue? |
| **Error messages** | Exact error text or screenshots |
| **Trace IDs / Request IDs** | Enables quick lookup in our systems (redact sensitive data) |
| **Code snippets** | Relevant code causing the error |
| **Environment details** | SDK version, language, environment (dev/prod) |
| **Impact level** | How many users/requests are affected? |

### Good Request Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bug Report Example" icon="bug">
    **Initial message:**
    
    > 🐛 **Bug: Chat completions returning 500 error intermittently on GPT-4**
    >
    > We're seeing intermittent 500 errors (~20% of requests) when calling chat completions through Portkey. Started around 2pm ET today.
    >
    > Trace IDs: `abc123`, `def456`, `ghi789`
    > Environment: Python SDK v1.2.3, Production
    > Impact: ~500 requests/hour affected

    **Thread reply with details:**
    
    > Error response:
    > ```json
    > {"error": {"message": "Internal server error", "code": 500}}
    > ```
    >
    > Steps to reproduce:
    > 1. Send chat completion to GPT-4 via gateway
    > 2. Include system message + 3-4 user messages
    > 3. Fails ~20% of the time
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Quick Question Example" icon="circle-question">
    **Initial message:**
    
    > Quick question: Is there a way to set request timeout at the virtual key level instead of per-request?
    >
    > Use case: Want all requests through a specific virtual key to have 30s timeout by default.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance Issue Example" icon="gauge-high">
    **Initial message:**
    
    > ⚠️ **Performance: Increased latency on gateway requests**
    >
    > Noticing p95 latency increased from ~200ms to ~800ms starting yesterday around 6pm ET.
    >
    > Before: p50=100ms, p95=200ms, p99=350ms
    > After: p50=300ms, p95=800ms, p99=1500ms
    >
    > Slow request trace IDs: `slow123`, `slow456`
    > Traffic: ~10k requests/hour
    > Nothing changed on our end
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Tips for Faster Resolution

<Tip>
The more context you provide upfront, the faster we can help — fewer back-and-forth messages means quicker resolution.
</Tip>

- **Be specific** — Avoid vague descriptions like "it doesn't work"
- **Include trace IDs** — These enable instant lookup in our systems
- **One issue per thread** — Easier to track and resolve
- **Use threads** — Keep all discussion in the thread, not the main channel
- **Respond promptly** — Quick responses speed up resolution
- **Share files** — Screenshots, logs, and code samples help tremendously

### Threading Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Do" icon="check">
    - Start new threads for new issues
    - Keep all replies in the thread
    - Use thread for back-and-forth
    - Share files within the thread
  </Card>
  <Card title="Don't" icon="xmark">
    - Reply to old threads with new issues
    - Post updates in main channel
    - Start multiple threads for same issue
    - Let threads get off-topic
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Understanding Ticket Statuses

Even though you're using Slack, your requests are tracked as tickets with statuses:

### Status Definitions

| Status | What It Means | What You Should Do |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **On Portkey** | We're reviewing and working on your request | Wait for our response — we'll reply in the thread |
| **On You** | We've responded and need your input | Review our response and reply in the thread |
| **Closed** | Issue has been resolved | Reply in thread to reopen if needed |

### How Statuses Change

Statuses update **automatically** based on conversation activity:

- **When you start a thread** → Status: "On Portkey"
- **When we reply asking for info** → Status: "On You"
- **When you reply to our question** → Status: "On Portkey"
- **When we resolve the issue** → Status: "Closed"

<Note>
**No manual action needed.** The system automatically determines who needs to take the next action based on conversation context.
</Note>

### Reopening Closed Issues

If a closed issue resurfaces:

1. **Reply to the original thread** — This automatically reopens the ticket
2. **Or start a new thread** — Reference the original for context

---

## Viewing Your Tickets

### In Slack

Your Slack threads are your ticket history. To find past issues:

- **Search the channel** — Use Slack's search to find old threads
- **Scroll back** — Browse channel history
- **Bookmark important threads** — Save threads for quick access

### In the Support Portal

All your Slack threads also appear in the [support portal](https://support.portkey.ai):

- **Unified view** — See all tickets regardless of channel
- **Search & filter** — Find tickets by status, date, or keyword
- **365-day history** — Full history even if Slack retention is shorter
- **Team visibility** — Admins can see all organization tickets

<Card title="Open Support Portal" icon="browser" href="https://support.portkey.ai">
  View all your tickets (Slack, email, and portal) in one place
</Card>

### Real-Time Sync

All channels sync automatically:

- **Reply via Slack** — Appears in portal and email
- **Reply via portal** — Appears in Slack thread and email
- **Reply via email** — Appears in Slack thread and portal

<Note>
**All channels are synced.** Regardless of how you communicate, everything appears in the same ticket thread.
</Note>

## How Tickets Are Closed

### Closure Methods

Tickets from Slack threads can be closed in several ways:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Portkey closes** | When we confirm the issue is resolved |
| **Auto-close** | After extended inactivity (you'll receive notice) |
| **Customer confirms** | When you acknowledge resolution in the thread |

### After Closure

- **Thread remains** — Still visible in your Slack channel history
- **Portal history** — Ticket accessible in portal for 365 days
- **Reopenable** — Reply to the thread to reopen automatically

### Post-Resolution

After a ticket is closed:

- You may receive a **satisfaction survey**
- **Premium customers** may receive RCA calls for severe incidents
- **Reference material** — Closed tickets serve as documentation

---

## Notifications

### How You'll Be Notified

| Event | Where |
|-------|-------|
| Portkey responds | Slack thread notification + email |
| Status changes | Portal badge indicator |
| Ticket closed | Slack thread message |

### Staying Updated

- **Watch the thread** — Slack notifies you of all thread replies
- **Check portal** — "On You" filter shows tickets awaiting your response
- **Email backup** — All updates also sent via email

## Escalation Procedures

### When to Escalate

Consider escalation when:

- **SLA breached** — No response within committed timeframe
- **Severity increased** — Issue has gotten worse since reported
- **Executive attention** — Business-critical situation

### How to Escalate

<Steps>
  <Step title="Reply in Thread" icon="reply">
    Reply to your thread requesting escalation with business justification
  </Step>
  <Step title="@mention Leadership" icon="at">
    Ask to escalate to engineering leadership in your thread
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Panic Button" icon="siren">
    For SEV 1 emergencies only — click the pinned Panic Button
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Panic Button (Premium Only)

<Warning>
**SEV 1 emergencies only.** The Panic Button is reserved for critical production outages.
</Warning>

The Panic Button URL is **pinned in your shared Slack channel**. How it works:

1. **Click the Panic Button** — Pinned URL at the top of the channel
2. **Add description** — Briefly describe the emergency
3. **Automatic escalation** — Opens SEV 1 ticket and pages on-call engineering
4. **Engineer joins** — First engineer responds within 15 minutes
5. **Hourly updates** — Continuous communication until mitigated

<Frame caption="Panic Button pinned in your shared Slack channel">
  <img src="/images/support/slack-panic-button.png" alt="Slack channel showing pinned Panic Button URL" />
</Frame>

### Handling Sensitive Data

<Warning>
**Redact sensitive information** before sharing in Slack.
</Warning>

- **Never include** — API keys, passwords, secrets, full PII

## Slack vs Portal: When to Use Each

| Use Slack When... | Use Portal When... |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| You need quick back-and-forth | You want to review all tickets at once |
| The issue is conversational | You need to search ticket history |
| You're already in Slack | You want to manage team access |
| Real-time discussion helps | You prefer a structured form |
| Premium Support customer | Any support tier |

<Tip>
**Both sync automatically.** Start in Slack, continue in portal — it's all the same ticket. Use whichever is convenient.
</Tip>
