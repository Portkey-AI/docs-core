## Getting Started

### How Email Support Works

When you send an email to [support@portkey.ai](mailto:support@portkey.ai):

1. **Ticket created** — Your email automatically creates a support ticket
2. **Tracked in portal** — The ticket appears in [support.portkey.ai](https://support.portkey.ai)
3. **Replies sync** — Email replies update the ticket thread
4. **Team visibility** — Organization Admins can see all tickets in the portal

### Who Can Use Email Support

- **All Enterprise customers** — No Premium upgrade required
- **Anyone with your domain** — Emails from your organization create trackable tickets
- **No portal account needed** — Works even without portal access

---

## Creating Support Requests

### Sending Your First Email

<Steps>
  <Step title="Compose Email" icon="pen">
    Create a new email to [support@portkey.ai](mailto:support@portkey.ai)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write Clear Subject" icon="heading">
    Use a descriptive subject line that summarizes the issue
  </Step>
  <Step title="Include Details" icon="list">
    Provide all relevant information in the body (see checklist below)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Attach Files" icon="paperclip">
    Include screenshots, logs, or other supporting files
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send" icon="paper-plane">
    Your email creates a ticket — you'll receive a confirmation
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Subject Line Best Practices

A good subject line helps us triage and route your request quickly:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Good Subject Lines" icon="check">
    - `[Production] 500 errors on chat completions`
    - `Integration question: Azure OpenAI fallback`
    - `Performance: High latency on GPT-4 requests`
    - `Bug: SDK v1.2.3 timeout not working`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Avoid" icon="xmark">
    - `Help`
    - `Question`
    - `It's not working`
    - `Urgent!!!`
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
**Include environment in subject** — Adding `[Production]` or `[Dev]` helps us prioritize correctly.
</Tip>

### Information to Include

The more context you provide, the faster we can help. Include as much of the following as possible:

| Include | Why It Helps |
|---------|--------------|
| **Clear description** | What's happening vs. what you expected |
| **Steps to reproduce** | How can we recreate the issue? |
| **Error messages** | Exact error text or screenshots |
| **Trace IDs / Request IDs** | Enables quick lookup in our systems (redact sensitive data) |
| **Code snippets** | Relevant code causing the error |
| **Environment details** | SDK version, language, environment (dev/prod) |
| **Impact level** | How many users/requests are affected? |

- **Documents** — Architecture diagrams, specs

<Note>
**File size limit:** Keep attachments under 25MB total. For larger files, use a file sharing service and include the link.
</Note>

### Tips for Faster Resolution

<Tip>
The more context you provide upfront, the faster we can help — fewer back-and-forth emails means quicker resolution.
</Tip>

- **Be specific** — Avoid vague descriptions like "it doesn't work"
- **Include trace IDs** — These enable instant lookup in our systems
- **One issue per email** — Easier to track and resolve
- **Reply in thread** — Keep all communication in the same email thread
- **Respond promptly** — Quick responses to our questions speed things up

---

## Understanding Ticket Statuses

Your emails are tracked as tickets with statuses visible in the [support portal](https://support.portkey.ai):

### Status Definitions

| Status | What It Means | What You Should Do |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **On Portkey** | We're reviewing and working on your request | Wait for our response — we'll email you |
| **On You** | We've responded and need your input | Review our email and reply |
| **Closed** | Issue has been resolved | Reply to reopen if the issue resurfaces |

### How Statuses Change

Statuses update **automatically** based on email activity:

- **When you send an email** → Status: "On Portkey"
- **When we reply asking for info** → Status: "On You"
- **When you reply to our question** → Status: "On Portkey"
- **When we resolve the issue** → Status: "Closed"

<Note>
**No manual action needed.** The system automatically determines who needs to take the next action based on the conversation.
</Note>

### Reopening Closed Issues

If a closed issue resurfaces:

1. **Reply to the original email thread** — This automatically reopens the ticket
2. **Or send a new email** — Reference the original ticket number for context

---

## Viewing Your Tickets

### Via Email

Your email thread is your ticket history:

- **Reply to receive updates** — All ticket updates come to your email
- **Keep the thread** — Don't start new emails for the same issue
- **CC teammates** — They'll receive updates too

### In the Support Portal

All your email tickets also appear in [support.portkey.ai](https://support.portkey.ai):

- **Unified view** — See all tickets regardless of channel
- **Search & filter** — Find tickets by status, date, or keyword
- **365-day history** — Full history available
- **Team visibility** — Admins can see all organization tickets

<Card title="Open Support Portal" icon="browser" href="https://support.portkey.ai">
  View all your tickets (email, portal, and Slack) in one place
</Card>

### Real-Time Sync

All channels sync automatically:

- **Reply via email** — Appears in portal and Slack (if available)
- **Reply via portal** — Appears in your email thread
- **Reply via Slack** — Appears in portal and email

<Note>
**All channels are synced.** Regardless of how you communicate, everything appears in the same ticket thread.
</Note>

---

## Email Threading

### How Email Threads Work

When you email [support@portkey.ai](mailto:support@portkey.ai):

1. **Initial email** → Creates a new ticket
2. **Reply to the thread** → Updates the same ticket
3. **New email (not a reply)** → Creates a new, separate ticket

<Warning>
**Always reply to the thread** for ongoing issues. Starting a new email creates a separate ticket and loses context.
</Warning>

### CC Behavior

- **CC teammates** — They'll receive all updates on the ticket
- **CC'd parties** — Can reply and their messages appear in the ticket
- **Organization visible** — Admins can see tickets from anyone in your org

### Multiple Recipients

If you CC multiple people:

- All CC'd parties receive ticket updates
- Any CC'd party can reply to the thread
- All responses appear in the same ticket

---

## RBAC & Permissions
