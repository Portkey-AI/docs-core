description: "Complete architecture and service requirements for deploying Portkey on Azure"
---

This guide provides complete architecture and service requirements for deploying Portkey on Azure for both **Hybrid** and **Full Private (Airgapped)** deployment models.

## Deployment Models

| Deployment Model | Description |
|:-----------------|:------------|
| **Hybrid** | Data Plane runs in your Azure environment; Control Plane hosted by Portkey |
| **Full Private (Airgapped)** | Both Data Plane and Control Plane run entirely in your Azure environment |

---

## Hybrid Deployment

In a Hybrid deployment, only the **Data Plane** components are deployed in your Azure environment. The **Control Plane** (dashboard, config management, analytics) is hosted and managed by Portkey.

            DataSvc["Data Service<br/>(1 pod)"]
            Gateway["AI Gateway<br/>(2 pods)"]
            DataSvc <--> Gateway
        end
        
        LB["Azure Load Balancer"]
        NAT["NAT Gateway"]
        RedisExt["Azure Managed Redis<br/>(Cache)"]
        Blob["Azure Blob Storage<br/>(Log Store)"]
        
        Gateway --> LB
        Gateway --> RedisExt
        Gateway --> Blob
        AKS --> NAT
    end
    
    subgraph Portkey["Portkey Control Plane"]
        CP["Dashboard, Config Management, Analytics"]
    end
    
    NAT -->|"Outbound HTTPS<br/>(Config Sync & Metrics Dump)"| CP
    CP -->|"Inbound HTTPS<br/>(Playground Calls & Logs Fetch)"| LB
```

### Required Azure Services

| Component | Azure Service | Sizing Recommendation |
|:----------|:-------------|:---------------------|
| **Kubernetes Cluster** | Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) | 4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM (minimum) |
| **Cache Store** | Azure Managed Redis | 6 GB (Basic or Standard tier) |
| **Log Store** | Azure Blob Storage | Serverless (no provisioned storage required) |
| **Load Balancer** | Azure Load Balancer | Standard tier (created via AKS Load Balancer Controller) |
| **Authentication** | Entra ID or Managed Identity | Access to Blob Storage |

### Network Requirements

<Note>
**Portkey Control Plane IP**: `44.221.117.129` — whitelist this for inbound accessing the playground and fetching individual logs.
</Note>

| Direction | Requirement |
|:----------|:-----------|
| **Outbound HTTPS** | Required for config sync with Portkey Control Plane |
| **Inbound HTTPS** | Required for Control Plane to fetch logs (if storing logs locally) |

---

## Full Private (Airgapped) Deployment

In a Full Private deployment, **all components** run within your Azure environment. This includes the complete Control Plane with the web dashboard, backend services, and analytics infrastructure.

### Architecture Diagram

flowchart TB
    subgraph Azure["Your Azure Environment (Fully Airgapped)"]
        subgraph AKS["AKS Cluster"]
            Frontend["Frontend<br/>(Web UI)"]
            Backend["Backend<br/>(API)"]
            Gateway["AI Gateway<br/>(2 pods)"]
            DataSvc["Data Service<br/>(1 pod)"]
            
            ClickHouse["ClickHouse<br/>(in-cluster or managed)"]
            
            Frontend <--> Backend
            Backend <--> Gateway
            Gateway <--> DataSvc
            Backend <--> ClickHouse
        end
        
        LB["Azure Load Balancer"]
        Blob["Azure Blob Storage<br/>(Log Store)"]
        RedisExt["Azure Managed Redis"]
        MySQLExt["Azure Database for MySQL"]
        
        Frontend --> LB
        Gateway --> Blob
        Backend --> RedisExt
        Gateway --> RedisExt
        DataSvc --> RedisExt
        Backend --> MySQLExt
    end
```

### Required Azure Services

| Component | Azure Service | Sizing Recommendation |
|:----------|:-------------|:---------------------|
| **Kubernetes Cluster** | Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) | 16 vCPU, 32 GB RAM (minimum) |
| **Transactional Database** | Azure Database for MySQL | 4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM |
| **Cache Store** | Azure Managed Redis | 6 GB (Standard tier recommended) |
| **Log Store** | Azure Blob Storage | Serverless (no provisioned storage required) |
| **Load Balancer** | Azure Load Balancer | Standard tier (created via AKS Load Balancer Controller) |
| **Authentication** | Entra ID or Managed Identity | Access to Blob Storage |


### Network Requirements

<Info>
**No outbound internet required** — This deployment is fully airgapped. Container images must be pre-loaded or pulled from a private registry.
</Info>

Internal load balancer recommended for private network access.
