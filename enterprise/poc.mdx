description: "Choose the fastest path to validate Portkey in your environment"
---

Portkey offers three deployment models for evaluating our technology. Each model comes with **No-Cost** and **Paid** proof-of-concept (PoC) tracks so you can pick the path that best fits your procurement, legal and security needs.

## Overview

| Option | Hosting / Data Residency | Up-front Cost | Contract | Trial Length | Fastest Next Step | Best For |
|:--------|:--------------------------|:---------------|:----------|:--------------|:-------------------|:----------|
| **SaaS Enterprise** | Portkey Cloud<br />(multi-tenant) | **$0** | *Optional* NDA / MSA | 14 days | Sign up & request trial | Quick functional test |
| **Hybrid<br />No-Cost** | Customer cloud<br />On-prem | **$0** | Standard MSA +<br />Order Form for Annual Contract | 30 days<br />*(auto-convert*) | Sign MSA & deploy gateway | On-prem eval with no risk |
| **Hybrid<br />Paid** | Customer cloud<br />On-prem | **$3,000** (credited) | Short-form MSA | 30 days | Sign short MSA & deploy | Need lighter legal lift |
| **Airgapped<br />No-Cost** | Fully offline environment | **$0** | Standard MSA +<br />Order Form for Annual Contract | 45–60 days<br />*(auto-convert*) | Sign MSA & receive images | Strict data-isolation needs |
| **Air-gapped<br />Paid** | Fully offline environment | **$5,000** (credited) | Short-form MSA | 45–60 days | Sign short MSA & receive images | Offline eval + faster legal |

## Hybrid PoC
<Steps>
<Step title="Why Choose Hybrid" icon="lightbulb">
* Data plane runs inside *your* network; only minimal control-plane metadata reaches Portkey.
* Maintain operational ownership while off-loading management of updates & new features.
</Step>

<Step title="Deployment Overview" icon="rocket">
* Deploy the **Enterprise Gateway** via Helm chart or container image.
* A single Helm install (or Docker Compose) gets you up and running.
* See the [Hybrid deployment guide](https://github.com/portkey-ai/helm) for prerequisites.
</Step>

<Step title="PoC Tracks" icon="book">
* **No-Cost track** — Standard MSA + Order Form, 30-day trial, auto-converts unless cancelled.
* **Paid track** — $3,000 up-front (credited), short-form MSA, 30-day trial, no auto-convert.
</Step>
</Steps>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Legal & Security Notes">
    <ul>
      <li>Gateway runs entirely in your VPC / on-prem environment.</li>
      <li>Only minimal control-plane metadata leaves your network.</li>
      <li>Standard Enterprise MSA governs data processing; short-form MSA available for the Paid track.</li>
    </ul>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Support & Extensions">
    <p>Daily syncs (or as requested) until your gateway is live. Need more than 30 days? Extensions are free—just reach out.</p>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Airgapped PoC
<Steps>
<Step title="Why Choose Air-gapped" icon="lightbulb">
* **No outbound traffic**: Gateway, logs, and all data remain inside your isolated network.
* **Offline licence server**: Pre-signed key enables the PoC with zero internet reach-back.
</Step>

<Step title="Deployment Overview" icon="rocket">
* Receive container images via secure private registry (or offline media).
* Install the **Enterprise Gateway** on your on-prem or cloud infrastructure.
* See the [Air-gapped deployment guide](https://github.com/portkey-ai/helm) for hardware specs.
</Step>

<Step title="PoC Tracks" icon="book">
* **No-Cost track** — Standard MSA + Order Form, 45–60-day trial, auto-converts unless cancelled.
* **Paid track** — $5,000 up-front (credited), short-form MSA, 45–60-day trial, no auto-convert.
</Step>
</Steps>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Legal & Security Notes">
    <ul>
      <li>Deployment is fully disconnected—no external network traffic.</li>
      <li>Images are delivered via private registry or offline media.</li>
      <li>Enterprise MSA governs data processing; short-form option for Paid track.</li>
    </ul>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Support & Extensions">
    <p>Daily syncs (or as requested) until your gateway is live. Need more than 60 days? Extensions are free—just reach out.</p>

## Evaluating the PoC

<Steps>
<Step title="Success Criteria & KPIs" icon="chart-line">
Not sure how to measure success? Common metrics include:

* Latency reduction vs. direct model calls
* Cost savings from caching & smart retries
* Guardrail violation rate
* Developer productivity (time to first prompt, etc.)

[**Schedule a KPI workshop**](https://cal.link/vrv) and we’ll tailor goals to your team.
</Step>

<Step title="Choosing the Right PoC" icon="circle-check">
* **SaaS** — Perfect for teams that want to get started ASAP, and are comfortable with cloud-hosted data.
* **Hybrid** — Best when data must stay in your VPC but an internet connection is acceptable.
* **Air-gapped** — Required when *no* external connectivity is permitted.
</Step>

<Step title="Trust & Compliance" icon="shield">
During the PoC—**and beyond**—your security team can access Portkey’s SOC 2 Type II report and other certifications directly via our **[trust portal](https://trust.portkey.ai)**.
</Step>

<Step title="Extensions, Cancellations & Conversions" icon="calendar">
* **Extensions** — Simply email your Portkey contact; we routinely grant extra time.
* **Cancelling No-Cost tracks** — Provide written notice within the trial window to stop auto-conversion.
* **Converting** — Sign an order form (or let auto-convert take effect) and continue using the same deployment—no downtime.
</Step>
</Steps>

## FAQs
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can we extend the PoC?">
Yes—extensions are free; contact us as early as possible so licences don’t lapse.
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="What data leaves our environment during Hybrid?">
Only minimal control-plane metadata (e.g., request IDs, usage metrics) leaves your VPC. All logs data stays local.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens to logs after the trial?">
You control log retention. If you decide not to convert, simply delete the object store or Mongo database used by the gateway.
