## Working with Tickets

### Ticket Statuses

Your tickets are automatically organized by status:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **On Portkey** | We're reviewing your request and will respond soon |
| **On You** | We've responded—your input is needed |
| **Closed** | Issue resolved |

<Tip>
Use the **search bar** or **filters** (by requester, source) to quickly find specific tickets. Ticket history is available for the last 365 days.
</Tip>

### Creating a New Ticket

Choose the channel that works best for you:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Portal" icon="browser" href="https://support.portkey.ai/forms/customer-portal-ticket-form">
    Click **Create Ticket** and fill out the form. Your ticket appears instantly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Slack" icon="slack">
    Start a thread in your shared Portkey channel. It automatically becomes a trackable ticket.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Email" icon="envelope" href="mailto:support@portkey.ai">
    Email **support@portkey.ai**. Your message creates a new ticket in the portal.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
**Attachments supported.** You can attach screenshots, log files, and other documents to help us diagnose your issue faster.
</Note>

### Tips for Faster Resolution

Include as much of the following as possible when creating a ticket:

| Include | Why It Helps |
|---------|--------------|
| **Clear description** | What's happening vs. what you expected |
| **Steps to reproduce** | How can we recreate the issue? |
| **Error messages** | Exact error text or screenshots |
| **Request/Response data** | Include trace IDs, request IDs (redact sensitive data) |
| **Code snippets** | Relevant code causing the error |
| **Environment details** | SDK version, language, environment (dev/prod) |

<Tip>
The more context you provide upfront, the faster we can help—fewer back-and-forth messages means quicker resolution.
</Tip>

### Responding to Tickets

Click any ticket to open the full conversation. From there you can:

- View the complete message history
- Send replies directly to the Portkey team
- See responses from your teammates
- Attach additional files or screenshots

<Note>
**All channels are synced.** Replies sent via portal, Slack, or email all appear in the same ticket thread.
