description: "Portkey's approach for Day-0 access to new models and capabilities"
---

Portkey is designed to ensure that we support the latest models, modalities, and capabilities as soon as they are available from providers. We decouple model availability from platform updates, so Portkey never becomes a bottleneck for your AI rollout.

This document describes how Portkey integrates new **models** (e.g., `gpt-6`, `claude-opus-5`) and **endpoints** (e.g., image/video generation, real-time audio), the typical timelines you can expect, and how to achieve Day-0 access even before native integration is complete.

## Scope of Support

**Chat & Reasoning Models**  
Integration of new LLMs (e.g., `gpt-6`, `claude-opus-5`) as first-class entities with full configuration, observability, guardrails, and policy enforcement.

**New Modalities & Capabilities**  
Extending the Gateway to support provider features across modalities, including:

- Image and video generation
- Audio and real-time streaming
- Embeddings
- Function/tool calling and agents
- Other provider-specific endpoints as they are released

**Unified Routing Layer**  
All integrated models and endpoints operate through Portkey’s unified routing layer with retries, fallbacks, caching, and loadbalancing.

---

## Notification Channels

We communicate new integrations and capabilities through three primary channels:

- **[Changelog](https://new.portkey.ai/)**  
  Comprehensive log of new models, endpoints, and feature releases, including configuration details.

- **[X (Twitter)](https://x.com/portkeyai)**  
  Announcements for high-impact model launches and major product updates.

- **[Portkey UI & Docs](https://docs.portkey.ai)**  
  New models and endpoints appear automatically in provider configuration lists, dropdowns, and docs, with relevant examples and implementation guidance.

---

## Monitoring & Ingestion Process

To maintain rapid parity with provider releases, Portkey uses a multi-signal monitoring and triage workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Provider Monitoring">
    We track official release notes, changelogs, API documentation, and developer roadmaps across all supported providers to detect new models and endpoints (text, image, video, audio, etc.) as they become available.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ecosystem Tracking">
    We monitor public announcements, conferences, community channels, and major research publications to anticipate high-impact launches and ecosystem-critical changes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customer Input">
    Enterprise customer requirements and requests are aggregated to prioritize specific models, modalities, and obscure or niche provider endpoints.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Internal Prioritization">
    All signals feed into an internal tracker, where updates are categorized by provider tier, modality, production impact, and customer priority to schedule immediate Gateway updates.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Target Integration Timelines

The following represent our standard operating targets for making new models and endpoints available through Portkey.

<Note>
  These are operational targets, not contractual SLAs. Formal SLAs are defined in your Enterprise MSA/SOW.  
  For contractual commitments or critical launch coordination, contact your Portkey account representative to establish explicit timelines.
</Note>

### Tier-1 Providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)

For generally available (GA) releases from Tier-1 providers:

- **Chat & reasoning models:** Typically integrated within **72 hours**.
- **New capabilities (image, video, audio, etc.):** Integrated within **3–5 business days**, depending on API complexity and stability.

Same-day support is common for models that share an existing, familiar API schema.

### Managed Providers

For other supported ecosystem providers:

- **Standard models and modalities:** Targeted integration within **7 business days** of general availability.

### Private & Custom Endpoints

For customer-specific deployments (e.g., private VPC/endpoints, on-prem inference, custom HTTP APIs):

- Integration timelines and scope are determined based on complexity and business priority.
- Once integrated, these endpoints inherit the full Gateway feature set, including routing, policy enforcement, observability, and analytics.

## Immediate Availability & Day-0 Access

You do not need to wait for a Portkey platform update or UI change to use a newly released model or endpoint. Before native support is fully integrated, customers can achieve Day-0 access through the following mechanisms:

### 1. Custom Model Configuration / IDs

If a new model is similar to previous models in terms of core functionalities, you can add it as a custom model.

- For any existing integration, edit it and go to "Model Provisioning" step
- Click on "Add Model" on the top right and add the new model slug
- Choose the base model and add custom pricing
- All standard Gateway features (logging, retries, caching, guardrails, metrics) apply to these calls.

### 2. Wildcard Model Routing

For providers with stable, schema-consistent APIs, Portkey supports wildcard routing:

- You can send requests to **any valid model name** accepted by the provider.
- Portkey passes the identifier through as-is while maintaining monitoring, error handling, and policy controls.
- This is ideal for experimenting with beta or preview models on Day-0.

### 3. Custom Endpoint Configuration

For entirely new capabilities or private infrastructure:

- Pick any existing provider that your API follows, and add your new API URL as the Custom Host, along with Auth details.
- Add your model in the Model Provisinoing step as a custom model.
- All standard Gateway features (logging, retries, caching, guardrails, metrics) apply to these calls.
- Native, first-class integration typically follows once the API surface stabilizes and is widely adopted.

## Lifecycle Management & Deprecation

Portkey aims to shield your applications from ecosystem churn when providers deprecate or modify models and APIs.

**Change Detection**  
We align with provider deprecation notices, changelog flags, and scheduled sunset dates to identify upcoming changes that may affect production workloads.

**Migration Guidance**  
Where relevant, we provide recommendations on:

- Replacement models or endpoints
- Behavioral and API surface differences
- Safe migration strategies, including A/B tests and dual-run patterns using Portkey routing and policies

**Version Control & Pinning**  

- Pin specific model versions to maintain behavioral stability and reproducibility.
- Alternatively, use provider-recommended "latest" aliases when you want Portkey to track new versions as they roll out.

---

## Enterprise Coordination & Prioritization

Enterprise customers have direct influence over our integration roadmap and timelines.

You can coordinate model and capability integration with your Portkey account team to:

- Request prioritization for specific models, modalities, or provider endpoints (including beta/preview variants like `claude-opus-5-tool-use`).
- Receive clear integration timelines and visibility into roadmap status.
- Plan production rollouts with confirmed support dates and, where needed, test integrations before broad documentation is available ("Fast Lane" access).

For critical launches or business-critical integrations, contact your Portkey representative for a dedicated plan and escalation path.
