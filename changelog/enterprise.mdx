<Update label="1.17.1" description="2025-11-19">

## v1.17.1
---
### Hook Results in Streaming Responses
- Added support for returning hook results in streaming responses for `/chat/completions`, `/completions`, `/embeddings`, and `/messages` endpoints. This enables you to stop streaming or display redacted content when a request violates guardrail policies, allowing clients to enforce content policy guidelines in real-time.
- [Documentation](/product/guardrails#streaming-responses)

### New Plugins
- **F5 Guardrails**: Added partner plugin integration with content moderation and PII detection/redaction capabilities.

### Provider Updates
- **Azure OpenAI**: Added support for `model-router`
- **TogetherAI**: Added support for image generation cost calculation
- **VertexAI**:
    - Added support for video generation (Veo models) cost calculation
    - Fixed MIME type mapping for opus format: Changed from `audio/ogg` to `audio/opus` for better accuracy
    - Added MIME type mapping for aliases: 'ogg', 'pcm', 'aac', and 'm4a' alongside their existing 'x-' prefixed variants
- **OpenAI and Azure OpenAI**: Added support for video generation (Sora models) cost calculation
- **Bedrock**: Fixed `count_tokens` endpoint errors for Anthropic models
- **Anthropic**: Added proper header forwarding for `anthropic-beta` and `anthropic-version` headers from the original request

### Fixes and Improvements
- Added and updated model pricing configurations across multiple providers
- Fixed issues in `/log/exports` endpoints
- Fixed an issue where the provider identifier was not being logged in the analytics store for some cases
- Updated internal dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
- Reduced model pricing configuration cache TTL for faster pricing updates

</Update>

<Update label="1.17.0" description="2025-11-17">

## v1.17.0
---
<Note>
**Requires a Helm repo update (>app-1.4.0)**
</Note>
<Note>
**For air-gapped deployments, `Backend` version v1.5.0 is required as it adds new columns in the analytics store**
</Note>

### Security Patch
- Removed root user from container image (BREAKING CHANGE). The container image used by this chart no longer runs as root. The image now runs processes with a non-root UID and enforces a non-root container securityContext. Requires Helm repo upgrade (>app-1.4.0) to deploy the new image and chart settings.

### Usage and Rate Limit Policy
- Introduced usage limits and rate limit policies, which allow organizations to apply flexible budget and rate limit controls based on dynamic conditions (API keys, metadata, workspace, etc.). 
- More details: [Documentation](/product/enterprise-offering/budget-policies) and [API Reference](/api-reference/admin-api/control-plane/policies)

### Logging Enhancements
- Added support for OpenTelemetry W3C trace context headers (`traceparent` and `baggage`) to enable integration with distributed tracing systems. 
- When these standard headers are present, they are automatically parsed and mapped to Portkey's internal tracing headers.

### Finetuning Cost Tracking
- Added cost calculation logic for fine-tuning operations across multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and Vertex AI).

### Hourly-Based Log Object Prefix
- Introduced support for hourly-based S3 file path prefixes.
- Set `LOG_STORE_FILE_PATH_FORMAT` environment variable to toggle between `v1` (flat structure - existing format) and `v2` (time-hierarchical) path formats. By default, it will use the existing format (v1).
- `v1` (default) - The object path will follow this structure: `30/<organisation-id>/<log-id>.json`
- `v2` - The object path will follow this structure: `30/<organisation-id>/<workspace-slug>/<year>/<month>/<day>/<hour>/<log-id>.json`
<Note>Changing the `LOG_STORE_FILE_PATH_FORMAT` environment variable only affects newly written logs. Previously written logs will retain their original path format and are not migrated to the new structure.</Note>
<Note>The new v2 prefix structure is currently not supported for air-gapped deployments where `LOG_STORE` is set to `control_plane`. Support will be added in a future release.</Note>

### Provider Updates
- **OpenAI and Azure OpenAI**: Fixed cached tokens cost calculation for `responses` endpoint

### Bedrock Converse API integration
- Bedrock's /chat/completions have been updated to use Bedrock converse API.
- This enables features like tool calls, vision, etc. for many bedrock models.
- This also removes the hassle of maintaining chat templating logic for llama and mistral models.

### VertexAI Image Generation
- Added support for Vertex Imagen models.

### Stable Diffusion v2 Models
- StabilityAI introduced v2 models with a new API signature. Gateway now supports both v1 and v2 models, with internal transformations for different API signatures.
- Supported for both stability-ai and bedrock providers.
- New models: Stable Image Ultra, Core, 3.0 and 3.5.

### Pydantic SDK Integration for Structured Outputs
- Done for GoogleAI and VertexAI (follows OpenAI)
- We previously added support for structured outputs through REST API. However, SDKs using Pydantic were not supported due to extra fields in the JSON schema.
- Added a dereferencing function that converts JSON schemas from the library to Google-compatible schemas.

### OpenAI and AzureOpenAI Prompt Cache Pricing
- Added support for handling prompt caching pricing for required models.

### New Providers
- Lambda (`lambda`): Supports chat completions and completions.

### Provider Updates
- **Perplexity**: Added the missing [DONE] chunk for stream calls to comply with OpenAI's spec.
- **VertexAI**: Fixed provider name extraction logic for meta models, so users can send it like other partner models (e.g., meta.`<model-name>`).
- **Google**: Added structured outputs support (similar to Vertex-ai).

### Fixes & Enhancements:
- Exclude files, batches, threads, etc. (all passthrough) from ```llm_cost_sum``` prometheus metric to avoid unnecessary labels.
