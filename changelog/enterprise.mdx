- [Docs](/integrations/llms/anthropic#processing-pdfs-with-claude)

### OTEL Configurations
- Added two new environment variables:
    - `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`: Sets the `service.name` resource attribute value.
    - `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`: Comma-separated `key=value` pairs which will be sent as individual resource attributes.

### New Providers
- **Ncompass**: Supports chat completions endpoint.
- **Lepton**: Supports chat completions, completions and transcriptions endpoints.
- **Snowflake Cortex**: Supports chat completions endpoint.

### Provider Updates

## v1.10.20
---

### OpenAI Embeddings Latency Improvements
- Improved response handling for OpenAI Embeddings resulting in significant reduction in response processing latency.

### Strict Metadata Enforcement
- Updated the preference for metadata logging. The new order is `Workspace Default Metadata > API Key Default Metadata > Incoming Request Metadata`.
- This provides better control to organisation and workspace admins. Values set by admins cannot be overridden by request level metadata fields.

### Strict Default Config Enforcement
- Added support to disable default config override for API keys. If config override is not allowed and user tries to send a new config in request as well, Gateway will throw a 400 error.

### Provider Updates
- **VertexAI**: If a batch record failed on the provider's end, the error will be retained in the final batch output file.
- **AzureOpenAI**: Fixed URL path construction logic for non-completions requests like batches and files where an extra `/v1` was getting added in the final URL, causing request failures.

### Fixes And Improvements
- Fixed an edge case where Batches, Files and Fine-tune endpoint threw an error when the passed config had `targets` field with a single virtual key in it.

### Pydantic SDK Integration for Structured Outputs
- Done for GoogleAI and VertexAI (follows OpenAI)
- We previously added support for structured outputs through REST API. However, SDKs using Pydantic were not supported due to extra fields in the JSON schema.
- Added a dereferencing function that converts JSON schemas from the library to Google-compatible schemas.

- **Google**: Added structured outputs support (similar to Vertex-ai).

### Fixes & Enhancements:
- Exclude files, batches, threads, etc. (all passthrough) from ```llm_cost_sum``` prometheus metric to avoid unnecessary labels.
