<Update label="1.6.0" description="2025-11-24">

## v1.6.0

### SCIM Group Workspace Mapping
- Introduced flexible group-to-workspace mapping, allowing you to provision groups from your identity provider (Okta or Azure Entra) with any naming convention and map them to Portkey workspaces and roles directly from the Portkey Control Plane
- [Documentation](/product/enterprise-offering/org-management/scim/group-management)

### Fixes and Improvements
- Fixed an issue where archived usage limit policies were not being skipped during processing
- Fixed non-streaming playground request errors caused by header conflicts
- Added support for `aws_region` parameter in Bedrock integration for `serviceRole` auth type.

### Usage and Rate Limit Policy
- Introduced usage limits and rate limit policy APIs, which allow organizations to apply flexible budget and rate limit controls based on dynamic conditions (API keys, metadata, workspace, etc.). 
- More details: [Documentation](/product/enterprise-offering/budget-policies) and [API Reference](/api-reference/admin-api/control-plane/policies)
