title: "November"  
---

November was a month of momentum across customers, models, governance, and community.

Teams like Snorkel AI continue to push the boundaries of evaluation and training pipelines, running multi-agent systems that compare and verify outputs across models like Anthropic and Gemini. We’ve been learning a lot from how organizations like these operate at scale.

On the platform side, we expanded our provider landscape, shipped multiple model releases on Day 0, and worked on enhancing our guardrails and observability.

We’re closing the year with conversations and gatherings across the community! If you’re attending <b>AWS re:Invent</b> and want to meet the core team behind Portkey, grab a 1:1 slot [here](https://calendly.com/d/csjy-mr6-vfg/aws-re-invent).

## How Snorkel AI runs multi-agents evals for frontier models

Snorkel AI has been doing some fascinating work around evaluating frontier models from Anthropic, Google, and others. Their team built a multi-agent evaluation system that plans, reasons, and verifies model outputs.

As the scale and complexity of these eval workloads increased, they needed a way to move beyond fragmented scripts and logs toward a single, reliable source of truth for debugging.

Read their [full breakdown](https://portkey.ai/blog/how-snorkel-evaluates-and-trains-top-ai-models) that includes architecture, evaluation flows, learnings, and infrastructure decisions.

## Platform

### Budget policies

You can now define usage budgets and throughput controls at an organization or team level, without configuring them individually using budget policies.
You can create usage limits and rate limit policies with conditions based on:

- API keys
- Metadata fields
- Workspaces
- Combined multi-condition rules

This makes governance far more scalable. See how you can set up usage limits and rate-limit policies [here](https://portkey.ai/docs/product/enterprise-offering/budget-policies).

### URL support in Conditional Router 

You can match requests based on the request's URL path, increases the for routing and giving you granular control over model selection. Read more about this [here](https://portkey.ai/docs/product/ai-gateway/conditional-routing#url-path-routing).

## Observability

### Improved trace visibility

You can now see traces by category, making it easier to understand whether traffic originated from chat, batch, routing, agent calls, or system functions.

### Detailed guardrail checks in logs

See guardrail-flagged events more prominently in logs, simplifying debugging of blocked, redacted, or policy-violating requests.

### OTEL Log Export [Experimental]

You can now export Gateway logs to an OpenTelemetry-compatible endpoint, aligned to experimental GenAI semantic conventions, allowing external systems to ingest AI activity traces. Read more about this [here](https://portkey.ai/docs/product/observability/opentelemetry#experimental-features).

## Guardrails

### F5 Guardrail

You can now configure **F5 Guardrails**, expanding Portkey’s guardrails ecosystem for runtime moderation, safety filtering, and structured response control. 

This enables additional security layers for production workloads and is especially useful when running automated agent pipelines or public-facing interfaces. See how you can implement F5 Guardrails [here](https://portkey.ai/docs/integrations/guardrails/f5-guardrails).

### Qualifire Guardrails

Qualifire offers a comprehensive suite of **AI safety and quality guardrails** designed to keep applications compliant, safe, and high-integrity in production. 

Their platform provides **20+ guardrail checks** spanning content risk, output validation, and policy compliance. See how you can implement Qualifire Guardrails [here](https://portkey.ai/docs/integrations/guardrails/qualifire).

### Guardrails in streaming responses

Streaming endpoints (`/chat/completions`, `/completions`, `/embeddings`, `/messages`) can now return guardrail evaluation results in real time.

This helps you to:

- Stop streaming mid-response
- Mask or redact content dynamically
- Enforce content policy on UI without waiting for the full generation
