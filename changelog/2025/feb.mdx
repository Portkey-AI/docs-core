**Taking Enterprise AI to New Heights! ðŸš€**

February brings major enhancements to Portkey's platform with unified APIs, advanced security features, and powerful integrations. We're particularly excited about our unified fine-tuning, files, and batches API that works across all major providersâ€”making multi-provider deployments simpler than ever.

We've also launched advanced PII redaction, auto instrumentation for popular frameworks, and expanded our model support with the latest releases from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and more.

Plus, we had an amazing time at the AI Engineering Summit in NYC and connecting with the community through the Latent Space podcast!

Let's explore what's new:

## Platform

**Unified Fine-tuning, Files & Batches API**

Managing AI assets across multiple providers just got dramatically simpler. Our unified API now offers:

- Consistent interface for fine-tuning across OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Google Vertex AI, AWS Bedrock, and Fireworks AI
- Standardized file upload endpoints for all supported providers
- Provider-agnostic batch processing that works with any model Portkey supports

This means you can:
- Develop once, deploy everywhere
- Easily A/B test fine-tuned models across providers
- Simplify your codebase with a single interface for all providers

**Advanced PII Redaction**

We've significantly enhanced our security capabilities with sophisticated PII redaction:

- Automatically detect and redact sensitive information (emails, phone numbers, SSNs) before they reach any LLM
- Replace sensitive data with standardized identifiers for consistent handling
- Seamless integration with our entire guardrails ecosystem

**Auto Instrumentation for Agent Frameworks**

Building AI agents is now even easier with automatic instrumentation for popular frameworks:

- Full support for CrewAI and LangGraph with zero configuration changes
- Retain all Portkey features: interoperability, metering, governance, routing, and more
- Simplified monitoring and management of complex agent systems

## Gateway Enhancements

**Custom Webhooks with Body Mutation**

A game-changing feature for request and response transformation:
- Mutate request/response bodies directly from your webhooks
- Simply return a transformedData object along with your verdict
- Automatically override existing request/response bodies based on your transformations

**Improved Provider Integrations**

- **Configurable Timeouts**: All Partner & Pro Guardrails now have configurable timeouts
- **Better Streaming**: Fixed Azure OpenAI streaming to include usage data in final chunks
- **Tool Handling**: Improved handling of tool_calls in Gemini responses with mixed text and tool calls
- **Vertex Caching**: The gateway now automatically caches your Vertex-generated tokens
- **Google Search Tool**: Added support for google_search as a separate tool from google_search_retrieval
- **Conditional Routing**: You can now conditionally route based on any request params and modify param values

## Enterprise

February continues the momentum with powerful enterprise features:

- **Azure Marketplace**: Portkey is now available on Azure Marketplace for simplified enterprise procurement
- **Multiple Owners**: Organizations can now have multiple owner accounts for improved management
- **Enhanced Role Management**: Change member roles directly from the UI
- **User Key Creation**: Create user-specific keys directly from the UI interface
- **Default Configs**: Attach default configurations and metadata to any API key you create
- **Performance Optimization**: Updated cache implementation to avoid redundant Redis calls
- **Browser SDK Support**: Run our SDK directly in the browser with Cross-Origin access support

We've expanded our integration ecosystem with powerful new additions:

- **Acuvity Guardrail**: Enhanced security with specialized content filtering
- **Zed Integration**: Secure, observe, and govern your LLM interactions for entire teams
- **AnythingLLM & JanHQ**: New integrations for expanded ecosystem compatibility
- **Grounding for Vertex & Gemini**: Improved factual accuracy for Google's AI models

## Scale & Impact

January was a record-breaking month for Portkey. We saw unprecedented enterprise adoption, closing more enterprise deals in January alone than in the final months of 2024 combined.

What's thrilling is the scale of AI adoption we're enabling: 

- Processed ~250M LLM calls in just the past week
- ~60% of calls have fallbacks configured
- ~39% of calls have load balancing or A/B Testing enabled
- A large percentage have at least one runtime guardrail check
