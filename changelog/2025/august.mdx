title: "August"
---
August was all about real-world impact and community.

Princeton and NYU shared how they're deploying Portkey across their institutions. Seeing our platform in action at these universities was incredible.

**Future of AI Platforms** brought together industry leaders from Doordash, Postman, Qure.ai and more for honest conversations about challenges and opportunities.

Meanwhile, we shipped what you asked for: multiple workspace guardrails, OTel instrumentation, and day-zero support for the latest models.

Here's what's new this month:
## Summary

## Highlights

### Making GenAI rollout easy with Ivy League institutions and Internet2
Together with Internet2, we co-hosted a webinar where Ivy League institutions like NYU** shared how universities are deploying GenAI across classrooms, research, and student services. 

The session highlighted how Portkey's AI Gateway provides secure model access, guardrails, and compliance support for educational institutions.

## Platform

### List models API
<img src="/images/changelog/list-models-api.png" alt="list-models-api" style={{ width: "100%", borderRadius: "8px", margin: "24px 0" }} />

You can now see a list of all models available through Portkey—along with basic details for each one. This makes it easier to discover which models you can use and compare providers and options. Read more about it [here](https://portkey.ai/docs/api-reference/inference-api/models/models).

### Unified + Portkey Batching
<img src="/images/changelog/portkey-batching.png" alt="Unified Batching" style={{ width: "100%", borderRadius: "8px", margin: "24px 0" }} />
Optimize throughput and reduce costs with our improved batching capabilities. We've implemented unified batching across all supported providers with intelligent request grouping for optimized performance. 

This reduces per-request overhead while providing automatic batch size optimization and configurable parameters to suit your specific needs. 

See how you can get started [here](http://localhost:3000/product/ai-gateway/batches).

### **OTel-based autoinstrumentation**

/>
Portkey now works as an OTel endpoint. Send telemetry from any OTel-compatible source into Portkey and view it alongside LLM call logs. End-to-end observability for performance, cost, and compliance. Super powerful for agent workflows. 

See how you can implement this [here](https://portkey.ai/docs/product/observability/opentelemetry)

This strengthens our observability even further!

### **Multiple guardrails at the workspace level**
<img src="/images/changelog/multiple-guardrails.webp" alt="Multiple Guardrails" style={{ width: "100%", borderRadius: "8px", margin: "24px 0" }} />
You can now define and enforce multiple guardrail policies at the workspace-level, making it easier to secure usage, filter content, and maintain compliance across your team.

### CRUD Guardrails API
Managing guardrails at scale just got easier. You can now create, update, retrieve, delete, and list guardrails directly via API.

This makes it simple to keep policies consistent across environments, automate changes, and integrate guardrail management into your CI/CD workflows. [Learn more](https://portkey.ai/docs/api-reference/admin-api/control-plane/guardrails/create-guardrail).

## New Models and Providers

- **Featherless.ai**: Access 11,900+ open-source models with unlimited tokens through a single gateway. [Learn more →](https://portkey.ai/docs/integrations/llms/featherless)
- **GPT-OSS Models**: OpenAI's new open-weight models with strong reasoning and tool use capabilities. 
- **Claude Opus 4.1**: Anthropic's latest flagship model with 74.5% performance on SWE-bench Verified. 


## 🌐 Community Highlights

### **Future of AI Platforms**
Leaders from **DoorDash, Postman, Qure.ai, and Qoala** joined us for the Future of AI Platforms. It turned into a night of sharp ideas, candid discussions, and bold visions for where AI is headed.
