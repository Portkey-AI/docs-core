It‚Äôs been a landmark month.

Portkey is now the **‚ú®official AI Gateway provider for Internet2 NET+‚ú®**, the gold standard for infrastructure across 300+ top U.S. universities including NYU, Harvard, Princeton, Cornell, and Berkeley. We‚Äôre now listed alongside AWS, Microsoft, and Google and we‚Äôre the youngest infra provider ever to make the cut!

Alongside this, we shipped major updates across the stack: expanded data residency support, enhanced logging and cost tracking for Claude Code, new providers and models, and more.

Let‚Äôs get into it!

## Internet2 ü§ù Portkey
Many universities face similar challenges when adopting GenAI: fragmented provider access, budgetary uncertainty, and regulatory pressure. Portkey helps address these by sitting between institutional systems and model providers by offering a single API with granular usage controls, analytics, and guardrails.

‚ÄúThe Internet2 NET+ Service Evaluation process for Portkey has been a demonstration of collaboration and efficiency,‚Äù said **Stratos Efstathiadis, Senior Director of Research Technology Services at NYU**. ‚ÄúThe synergy among peer institutions ensures Portkey meets the diverse AI requirements of higher education.‚Äù

## Platform

**Regional data residency**

All your LLM data can now be hosted in any region of your choice with strict isolation, no cross-border data flow, and full compliance with residency regulations.

- Meet institutional and regional privacy mandates

- Improve latency by routing traffic through nearby zones

**Log exports**

You can now export logs directly from the Portkey UI or through the API. Whether you're debugging, auditing, or building internal dashboards, you can export and access complete logs in a structured, reliable format.

**Transformed requests in logs**

  <img src="/images/changelog/transformed-logs.png" alt="transformed logs" width="100%" style={{ borderRadius: "12px" }} />
</Frame>

Debugging just got simpler. You can now view the original request as received by Portkey, the transformed version sent to the model provider, and same for the response in logs, making it easier for debugging.

**Privacy mode (logging off)**

Portkey now gives org owners granular control over what gets logged, from full request/response payloads to just minimal metadata. 

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/changelog/privacy-mode.png" alt="transformed logs" width="100%" style={{ borderRadius: "12px" }} />
</Frame>

This can be configured org-wide or per workspace, offering flexibility for sensitive or regulated use cases.[Configure it for your org](https://portkey.ai/docs/product/administration/configuring-request-logging).

**Automatic user attribution on API keys** 

Every request made using a user API key now automatically carries `_user` metadata, with an option to override.

## Guardrails

**Palo Alto Networks‚Äô AIRS Plugin**

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/changelog/prisma-airs.png" alt="AIRS Plugin" width="100%" style={{ borderRadius: "12px" }} />
</Frame>
Portkey now integrates with PANW AIRS (AI Runtime Security) to enforce guardrails that block risky prompts or model responses based on real-time security analysis. [Learn more](https://portkey.ai/docs/integrations/guardrails/palo-alto-panw-prisma)

**CRUD Guardrails endpoint**

We‚Äôve added full support for managing guardrails via API ‚Äî create, update, delete, and list guardrail rules and templates programmatically. [Learn more](https://portkey.ai/docs/api-reference/admin-api/control-plane/guardrails/create-guardrail)


## Gateway

**Support for messages route(beta)**

In addition to `chat.completions`, Portkey now supports the `messages` route (beta) for Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, and Vertex AI. This includes tool calling, thinking, multi-turn conversations, and redacted thinking support
