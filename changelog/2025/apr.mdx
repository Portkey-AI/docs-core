**April in review! 🧪✨**

We kicked off April with an announcement— we make 95% of LLM costs vanish overnight. Excuse us if you took the bait!

While we can’t make bills disappear with a snap, we’ve delivered some powerful upgrades this month that will help you build and ship robust, reliable GenAI apps, faster!

This month, we introduced workspace-level budget and rate limits, Prompt CRUD APIs, virtual keys for self-hosted models, and powerful new integrations with OpenAI Codex CLI and n8n. We added support for the latest models like GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4, and Qwen 3, and brought enhanced security and moderation with AWS KMS, SCIM, and expanded guardrail coverage.

Here’s what we shipped this month:

## Platform

**Prompt CRUD APIs**

Prompt CRUD APIs give you the control to scale by enabling you to:

- Programmatically create, update, and delete prompts
- Manage prompts in bulk or version-control them
- Integrate prompt updates into your own tools and workflows
- Automate updates for A/B testing and rapid experimentation

Read more about this [here](https://portkey.ai/docs/api-reference/admin-api/control-plane/prompts/create-prompt).

**Export logs to your internal stack**

Enterprises can now push analytics logs to any OTEL-compliant store through Portkey to centralize monitoring, maintain compliance, and ensure efficient operations.
See how it's done [here](https://portkey.ai/docs/product/enterprise-offering/components#analytics-store)

**Budget limits and rate limts on workspace**

Configure budget and rate limits at the workspace level to:

- Allocate specific budgets to different departments, teams, or projects
- Prevent individual workspaces from consuming disproportionate resources
- Ensure equitable API access and complete visibility

**n8n integration**

Add enterprise-grade controls to your n8n workflows with:

- **Unified AI Gateway**: Connect to 1600+ models with full API key management—not just OpenAI or Anthropic.
- **Centralized observability**: Track 40+ metrics and request logs in real time.
- **Governance**: Monitor spend, set budgets, and apply RBAC across workflows.
- **Security guardrails**: Enable PII detection, content filtering, and compliance controls.

Read more about the integration[here](https://portkey.ai/docs/integrations/libraries/n8n)

**OpenAI Codex CLI integration**

OpenAI Codex CLI gives developers a streamlined way to analyze, modify, and execute code directly from their terminal. Portkey's integration enhances this experience with:

- Access to 250+ additional models beyond OpenAI Codex CLI's standard offerings
- Content filtering and PII detection with guardrails
- Real-time analytics and logging
- Cost attribution, budget controls, RBAC, and more!

Read more about the integration[here](https://portkey.ai/docs/integrations/libraries/codex#openai-codex-cli)

**Other updates**

- Introduced a new retry setting `use_retry_after_header`. When set to true, if the provider returns the `retry-after` or `retry-after-ms headers`, the Gateway will use these headers to determine retry wait times, rather than applying the default exponential backoff for 429 responses.
- You can now store and retrieve vector embeddings for semantic cache using Milvus in Portkey. Read more about semantic cache store [here](https://portkey.ai/docs/product/enterprise-offering/components#semantic-cache-store)
- Plugins have now been moved under Settings (org-level) in the Portkey app.
- Virtual Key exhaustion alert emails now include which workspace the exhausted key belonged to.
- Set up your workspace with Workspace control on the Portkey app.

## Gateway & Providers

**OpenAI embeddings response**
We’ve optimized the Gateway’s handling of OpenAI embeddings requests, leading to around 200ms improvement in response latency.

**Responses API**

You can now use the Responses API to access OpenAI and Azure OpenAI models on Portkey, enabling a flexible and easier way to create agentic experiences.

- Complete observability and usage tracking
- Caching support for streaming requests
- Access to advanced tools — web search, file search, and code execution, with per-tool cost tracking

**Bedrock prompt caching**

You can now implement Amazon Bedrock’s prompt caching through our OpenAI-compliant unified API and prompt templates. 

- Cache specific portions of your requests for repeated use
- Reduce inference response latency and input token costs 

Read more about the implementation [here](https://portkey.ai/docs/integrations/llms/bedrock/prompt-caching)

**Virtual keys for self-hosted models**

You can now create a virtual key for any self-hosted model - whether you're running Ollama, vLLM, or any custom/private model.

- No extra setup required
- Stay in control with logs, traces, and key metrics
- Manage all your LLM interactions through one interface

**Advanced capabilities**

- **Openrouter**: Added mapping for new parameters - modalities, reasoning, transforms, provider, models, response_format.
- **Vertex AI**: Added support for explicitly mentioning mime_type for urls sent in the request. Gemini 2.5 thinking parameters are now available.
- **Perplexity**: Added support for response_format and search_recency_filter request parameters.
- **Bedrock**: You can now pass the `anthropic_beta` parameter in Bedrock’s Anthropic API via Portkey to enable Claude's Computer use beta feature.

**Tool calling**

Portkey now supports tool calling for Groq, OpenRouter, and Ollama

**Technical Improvements**

- **Caching and Logging Unified Thinking Responses**: Unified thinking response (content_blocks) now logged and cached for stream responses. 
- **Strict Metadata Enforcement**: The metalogging preference order now is `Workspace Default > API Key Default > Incoming Request`. This is provide better control to org admins and ensure values set by them are not overridden.
- **Prompt render endpoint**: Previously only available via the control plane, the prompt render endpoint is now supported directly on the Gateway URL.
- Default config in an API key can no longer be overridden.

## Guardrails

- **Azure AI content safety**: Use Microsoft’s content filtering solution to moderate inputs and outputs across supported models.

- **Exa Online Search**: You can now configure Exa Online Search as a Guardrail in Portkey to enable real-time, grounded search across the web before answering. This makes any LLM capable of handling current events or live queries without needing model retraining.

We've made significant improvements to our documentation:

- **Virtual keys access**:  Defining who can view and manage virtual keys within workspaces. [Learn more](https://portkey.ai/docs/product/administration/configure-virtual-key-access-permissions)
- **API keys access**: Control how workspace managers and members interact with API keys within their workspaces. [Learn more](https://portkey.ai/docs/product/administration/configure-api-key-access-permissions)
