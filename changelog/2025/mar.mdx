## Platform

### Prompt Engineering Studio

<img src="/images/changelog/prompt-engineering-studio.png" />

Our flagship release this month is the Prompt Engineering Studio - the world's most advanced toolkit for building, testing, and deploying AI prompts at scale. With support for 1600+ models, version control, and native agent framework integration, teams can now craft and optimize prompts 75% faster.

We call it the IDE for Prompt Engineers. [Try it now at prompts.new](https://prompts.new) ðŸš€

### Major Enterprise Features

#### Organization and Workspace Level Guardrails

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Organization Guardrails" href="/product/administration/enforce-orgnization-level-guardrails">
Org-wide policy enforcement for all requests
</Card>
<Card title="Workspace Guardrails" href="/product/administration/enforce-workspace-level-guardials">
Workspace-specific security policies
</Card>
</CardGroup>

Portkey now enables organization owners to enforce request guardrails at both organization and workspace levels. This highly useful enterprise feature ensures all API requests comply with predefined security policies, enhancing compliance and governance.

Organizations can also apply guardrails at the API key level with default configurations - [learn more](/product/administration/enforce-default-config).

#### Mandatory Metadata Requirements

<img src="/images/product/org-level-metadata.png" />

Portkey allows organisation owners to define mandatory [metadata](/product/observability/metadata) fields that must be included with every API request, enabling granular observability across your entire LLM infrastructure.

<Card title="Workspace Guardrails" href="/product/administration/enforce-workspace-level-guardials">
Workspace-level policy enforcement
</Card>
</CardGroup>

Portkey enables organization owners to enforce request guardrails at the organization level. This feature ensures that all API requests made within the organization comply with predefined policies, enhancing security, compliance, and governance.

This highly useful feature for enterprises allows network level guardrails for all AI use cases at both Organization and Workspace levels. Organizations can also apply guardrails at the API key level with default configs - [learn more](/product/administration/enforce-default-config).

#### Enforce Org Level Metadata Requirements

Portkey allows organisation owners to define mandatory [metadata](/product/observability/metadata) fields that must be included with every API request. This feature enables granular observability across your organisation's LLM usage.

Organizations can enforce metadata requirements when creating Workspaces or API keys, mandating specific fields for all requests.
