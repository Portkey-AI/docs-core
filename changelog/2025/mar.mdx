**Introducing the Prompt Engineering Studio! ðŸ§ªâœ¨**

March brings the official launch of our highly anticipated Prompt Engineering Studio â€“ a comprehensive platform for creating, testing, and deploying production-ready prompts with confidence.

We're also excited to announce that Portkey is now being evaluated as the official AI Gateway solution by several prestigious universities, including Harvard, Princeton, and UC Berkeley.

Additionally, we've expanded our multimodal capabilities with Claude image support, added PDF uploads, and introduced thinking mode across major providers. All this with enhanced enterprise security through AWS KMS integration and SCIM for identity management.

Let's explore all that's new:
