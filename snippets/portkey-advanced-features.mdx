# 3. Set Up Enterprise Governance

**Why Enterprise Governance?**
- **Cost Management**: Controlling and tracking AI spending across teams
- **Access Control**: Managing team access and workspaces
- **Usage Analytics**: Understanding how AI is being used across the organization
- **Security & Compliance**: Maintaining enterprise security standards
- **Reliability**: Ensuring consistent service across all users
- **Model Management**: Managing what models are being used in your setup

Portkey adds a comprehensive governance layer to address these enterprise needs.

### Step 1: Implement Budget Controls & Rate Limits

Model Catalog enables you to have granular control over LLM access at the team/department level. This helps you:
- Set up [budget limits](/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys/budget-limits)
- Prevent unexpected usage spikes using Rate limits
- Track departmental spending

#### Setting Up Department-Specific Controls:
1. Navigate to [Model Catalog](https://app.portkey.ai/model-catalog) in Portkey dashboard
2. Create new Provider for each engineering team with budget limits and rate limits
3. Configure department-specific limits

  <Accordion title="Step 2: Define Model Access Rules">
### Step 2: Define Model Access Rules

As your AI usage scales, controlling which teams can access specific models becomes crucial. You can simply manage AI models in your org by provisioning model at the top integration level.

<Accordion title="Step 4: Set Routing Configuration">
    Portkey allows you to control your routing logic very simply with it's Configs feature. Portkey Configs provide this control layer with things like:

- **Data Protection**: Implement guardrails for sensitive code and data
- **Reliability Controls**: Add fallbacks, load-balance, retry and smart conditional routing logic
- **Caching**: Implement Simple and Semantic Caching. and more....

#### Example Configuration:
Here's a basic configuration to load-balance requests to OpenAI and Anthropic:

```json
{
	"strategy": {
		"mode": "load-balance"
	},
	"targets": [
		{
			"override_params": {
				"model": "@YOUR_OPENAI_PROVIDER_SLUG/gpt-model"
			}
		},
		{
			"override_params": {
				"model": "@YOUR_ANTHROPIC_PROVIDER/claude-sonnet-model"
			}
		}
	]
}
```

Create your config on the [Configs page](https://app.portkey.ai/configs) in your Portkey dashboard. You'll need the config ID for connecting.


<Note>
Configs can be updated anytime to adjust controls without affecting running applications.

  <Accordion title="Step 4: Implement Access Controls">
### Step 3: Implement Access Controls

Create User-specific API keys that automatically:
- Track usage per developer/team with the help of metadata
- Apply appropriate configs to route requests
- Collect relevant metadata to filter logs
- Enforce access permissions


Create API keys through:
- [Portkey App](https://app.portkey.ai/)
- [API Key Management API](/api-reference/admin-api/control-plane/api-keys/create-api-key)


Example using Python SDK:
```python
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(api_key="YOUR_ADMIN_API_KEY")

api_key = portkey.api_keys.create(
    name="frontend-engineering",
    type="organisation",
    workspace_id="YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID",
    defaults={
        "config_id": "your-config-id",
        "metadata": {
            "environment": "development",
            "department": "engineering",
            "team": "frontend"
        }
    },
    scopes=["logs.view", "configs.read"]
)
```

For detailed key management instructions, see our [API Keys documentation](/api-reference/admin-api/control-plane/api-keys/create-api-key).

  <Accordion title="Step 5: Deploy & Monitor">
### Step 4: Deploy & Monitor
After distributing API keys to your engineering teams, your enterprise-ready setup is ready to go. Each developer can now use their designated API keys with appropriate access levels and budget controls.
Apply your governance setup using the integration steps from earlier sections
Monitor usage in Portkey dashboard:
- Cost tracking by engineering team
- Model usage patterns for AI agent tasks
- Request volumes
- Error rates and debugging logs

# Portkey Features
Now that you have an enterprise-grade setup, let's explore the comprehensive features Portkey provides to ensure secure, efficient, and cost-effective AI operations.

### 1. Comprehensive Metrics
Using Portkey you can track 40+ key metrics including cost, token usage, response time, and performance across all your LLM providers in real time. You can also filter these metrics based on custom metadata that you can set in your configs. Learn more about metadata here.

<Frame>

</Frame>

### 2. Advanced Logs
Portkey's logging dashboard provides detailed logs for every request made to your LLMs. These logs include:
- Complete request and response tracking
- Metadata tags for filtering
- Cost attribution and much more...

<Frame>

### 3. Unified Access to 1600+ LLMs

You can easily switch between 1600+ LLMs. Call various LLMs such as Anthropic, Gemini, Mistral, Azure OpenAI, Google Vertex AI, AWS Bedrock, and many more by simply changing the `virtual key` in your default `config` object.


### 4. Advanced Metadata Tracking
Using Portkey, you can add custom metadata to your LLM requests for detailed tracking and analytics. Use metadata tags to filter logs, track usage, and attribute costs across departments and teams.

Portkey provides several ways to track team costs:
- Create separate Virtual Keys for each team
- Use metadata tags in your configs
