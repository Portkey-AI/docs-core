After adding an MCP server to the registry, control who can access it at the workspace and user level. Access is managed from the **Access Control & Limits** tab.

### Workspace access

Open the MCP server in the registry. Go to **Access Control & Limits**.

You'll see all workspaces in your organization. Toggle on the teams that should have access.

**What teams see**

Once provisioned, team members see the server in their **MCP** section in the sidebar. Each server shows:
- Server name and status
- Available tools
- Connection URL
- Test interface

**Connection URLs**

Each server has a connection URL that developers use in their agents:

```
https://mcp.portkey.ai/{server-slug}/sse
```

The API key determines which team the request belongs to. Create team-specific API keys in **Settings > API Keys**.

**Auto-provision for new teams**

Toggle **Automatically provision this integration for new workspaces** to give new teams access by default.

### User access

Control which users can access an MCP server and what capabilities they have.

**View users**

The **Access Control & Limits** tab also shows all users connected to the server.

Each user shows:
- Name and email
- Number of enabled capabilities
- Connection type (OAuth or Token)
- Last activity

**Add users**

Click **Add User** to grant access to specific users. Choose:
- **Connection Type**: OAuth 2.1 or Personal Access Token
- **Capabilities**: Toggle which tools/resources/prompts they can use

**Manage user access**

Click the menu on any user row to:
- **Manage Capabilities**: Enable/disable specific tools for this user
- **Reset Connection**: Force re-authentication
- **Revoke Access**: Remove the user's access entirely

### The inheritance model

Access is subtractive. Each level can only remove access, never add it.

```
Org enables: A, B, C, D, E
Team disables: E
User disables: C, D

User can access: A, B
```

If the org disables a capability, no team or user can access it. If a team disables a capability, no user in that team can access it.
