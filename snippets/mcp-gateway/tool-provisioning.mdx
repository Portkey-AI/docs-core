Each MCP server exposes capabilities: **Tools**, **Resources**, and **Prompts**. The Capabilities tab shows everything the server offers.

**View capabilities**

Filter by type (Tools, Resources, Prompts) or search by name. Each capability shows:
- Name and description
- Type (Tool, Resource, Prompt)
- Usage statistics
- Test/Preview button

**Organization-level controls**

Enable or disable capabilities for the entire organization.

Disabled capabilities:
- Don't appear in tool listings
- Return errors if called
- Can't be enabled by teams or users

Use this to block capabilities before anyone can access them:
- Dangerous operations (data deletion, admin actions)
- Untested tools you haven't reviewed
- Deprecated tools you're phasing out

**Test capabilities**

Click **Test** or **Preview** next to any capability. A panel opens where you can:
1. See the full schema
2. Enter test parameters
3. Execute the capability
4. View the response
