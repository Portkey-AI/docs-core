The **Capabilities** tab lists all tools, resources, and prompts exposed by an MCP server. Toggle them on or off, or use **Enable All** / **Disable All** for bulk changes.

Tool provisioning can be done at two levels:

| Location | Who | Scope |
|----------|-----|-------|
| **MCP Registry** → Server → Capabilities | Org Admins/Owners | Organization-wide |
| **MCP Servers** → Server → Capabilities | Workspace Managers/Admins | Workspace-only |

Disabled capabilities are hidden and return errors if called directly. Use this to block dangerous operations, untested tools, or deprecated functionality.
