## Overview

Claude Desktop supports MCP (Model Context Protocol) for enhanced AI capabilities through custom connectors. Through Portkey's MCP Gateway, you can seamlessly connect any MCP server to Claude Desktop without managing infrastructure or authentication.

### Key Benefits
- **Secure Authentication**: Portkey handles OAuth flows and token management
- **Unified Authentication**: Single OAuth token to rule them all
- **Team Collaboration**: Share MCP server configurations, manage access permissions, and ensure everyone on your team has the tools they needâ€”configured correctly, every time
- **Complete Observability**: See every request, track latency, monitor errors, and understand usage patterns

2. **Subsequent Connections**: Authentication tokens are refreshed automatically

3. **Team Access**: Workspace members share the same authentication scope based on your Portkey settings
