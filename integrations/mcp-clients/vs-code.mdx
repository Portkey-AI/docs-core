description: Connect your MCP servers to Visual Studio Code through Portkey's secure MCP gateway
---

## Overview

Visual Studio Code supports MCP (Model Context Protocol) through GitHub Copilot for enhanced AI-powered development capabilities. Through Portkey's MCP Gateway, you can seamlessly connect any MCP server to VS Code without managing infrastructure or authentication.

### Key Benefits
- **Secure Authentication**: Portkey handles OAuth flows and token management
- **Unified Authentication**: Single OAuth token to rule them all
- **Team Collaboration**: Share MCP server configurations, manage access permissions, and ensure everyone on your team has the tools they needâ€”configured correctly, every time
- **Complete Observability**: See every request, track latency, monitor errors, and understand usage patterns

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. **Visual Studio Code** installed (latest version)
2. **GitHub Copilot** access and extension installed
3. **MCP support enabled** in VS Code (enabled by default)
4. **Portkey account** with workspace access
5. **MCP server** registered in Portkey's MCP Hub

### Verify MCP Support

Check that MCP is enabled in VS Code:
- Open Settings (`Cmd/Ctrl + ,`)
- Search for `chat.mcp.access`
- Ensure it's not set to `none`

## Quick Setup

### Step 1: Get Your MCP Server URL

1. Log in to [Portkey Dashboard](https://app.portkey.ai)
2. Navigate to **MCP Hub** â†’ **Your Servers**
3. Copy your server URL:
   ```
   https://mcp.portkey.ai/:workspace-id/:server-id/mcp
   ```

### Step 2: Configure VS Code

#### Option A: Workspace Configuration (Recommended for Teams)

1. Create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your workspace root
2. Add your Portkey MCP server configuration:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "portkey-mcp": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.portkey.ai/:workspace-id/:server-id/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option B: Using Command Palette

1. Open Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`)
2. Run `MCP: Add Server`
3. Choose `HTTP` as the server type
4. Enter your Portkey MCP server URL
5. Select `Workspace Settings` to save configuration

### Step 3: Trust and Start Server

When you first use the MCP server, VS Code will prompt you to confirm trust. Click **Trust** to enable the server.

### Step 4: Authentication

Portkey handles all authentication flows automatically:

1. **First Connection**: When VS Code first connects to an authenticated MCP server, Portkey will:
   - Open your browser for OAuth authorization (if required)
   - Store credentials securely
   - Maintain session state

2. **Subsequent Connections**: Authentication tokens are refreshed automatically

3. **Team Access**: Workspace members share the same authentication scope based on your Portkey settings

## Configuration Examples

### Single Server Setup

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "linear-integration": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.portkey.ai/ws-abc123/linear-def456/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Multiple Servers Setup

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "linear": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.portkey.ai/ws-abc123/linear-def456/mcp"
    },
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.portkey.ai/ws-abc123/github-ghi789/mcp"
    },
    "slack": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.portkey.ai/ws-abc123/slack-jkl012/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```
