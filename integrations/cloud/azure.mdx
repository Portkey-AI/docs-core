## Get Started in Minutes

1.  **Deploy from the Azure Marketplace**: Launch Portkey directly within your Azure subscription.
2.  **Connect Microsoft Entra ID for SSO & SCIM**: Follow our [SSO guide](/product/enterprise-offering/org-management/sso) and [Azure SCIM setup](/product/enterprise-offering/org-management/scim/azure-ad).
3.  **Create Virtual Keys in Portkey**: Link your Azure OpenAI resources or Azure AI Foundry model deployments.
4.  **Enable Azure Content Safety Guardrails**: Configure content filters within your Portkey Configs.
5.  **Instrument Your Applications**: Use your preferred SDK (like the C# example below) to route requests through Portkey.

1.  **Complete Cost Visibility & Control on Azure Spend**: Go beyond standard Azure billing. Portkey allows you to tag every AI request (by application, environment, user, or custom dimension) and export granular metrics to Azure Monitor or your data warehouse for precise cost attribution and budget management.
2.  **Unified Governance & Security Across Your Azure AI Landscape**: Enforce organization-wide policies consistently. From robust content moderation with Azure Content Safety to PII detection, rate limits, and SSO via Microsoft Entra ID, Portkey centralizes governance across all your Azure AI services and Portkey workspaces.
3.  **Fortified Security with Azure-Native Integration**: Leverage Azure's robust security model. With Portkey's Azure Marketplace deployment or Private Cloud options, secrets remain securely in Azure Key Vault, and AI traffic can be configured to never leave Azure’s backbone, ensuring compliance and data integrity.
4.  **Boosted Developer Velocity & Efficiency**: Eliminate redundant setups and streamline AI development. Portkey provides a single, consistent gateway layer, removing the need for per-team Azure OpenAI subscriptions or duplicated infrastructure, allowing your teams to build faster.
5.  **Seamless Integration with the Azure Ecosystem**: Portkey is built for Azure. Enjoy native support for Azure OpenAI (chat, vision, function-calling, images), Azure AI Foundry Models, and even familiar Microsoft tooling like the OpenAI C# SDK and Semantic Kernel, all while Portkey handles the complexities of routing, cost attribution, and guardrails.
