## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
```bash
pip install -U strands-agents strands-agents-tools openai portkey-ai
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Replace Your Model Initialization">
Instead of initializing your OpenAI model directly:
```python
# Before: Direct OpenAI
from strands.models.openai import OpenAIModel

model = OpenAIModel(
    client_args={"api_key": "sk-..."},
    model_id="gpt-4o",
    params={"temperature": 0.7}
)
```

Initialize it through Portkey's gateway:
```python
# After: Through Portkey
from strands.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from portkey_ai import PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL

model = OpenAIModel(
    client_args={
        "api_key": "YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",  # Your Portkey API key
        "base_url": PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL     # Routes through Portkey
    },
    model_id="gpt-4o",
    params={"temperature": 0.7}
)
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Your Agent Normally">
```python
from strands import Agent
from strands_tools import calculator

agent = Agent(model=model, tools=[calculator])
response = agent("What is 2+2?")
print(response)
```

Your agent works exactly the same way, but now all interactions are automatically logged, traced, and monitored in your Portkey dashboard.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How the Integration Works

The integration leverages Strands' flexible `client_args` parameter, which passes any arguments directly to the OpenAI client constructor. By setting `base_url` to Portkey's gateway, all requests route through Portkey while maintaining full compatibility with the OpenAI API.

```python
# This is what happens under the hood in Strands:
client_args = client_args or {}
self.client = openai.OpenAI(**client_args)  # Your Portkey config gets passed here
```

This means you get all of Portkey's features without any changes to your agent logic, tool usage, or response handling.

## Setting Up Portkey

Before using the integration, you need to configure your AI providers and create a Portkey API key.

<Steps>
<Step title="Add Your AI Provider Keys">
Go to [Virtual Keys](https://app.portkey.ai/virtual-keys) in the Portkey dashboard and add your actual AI provider keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). Each provider key gets a virtual key ID that you'll reference in configs.
</Step>

<Step title="Create a Configuration">
Go to [Configs](https://app.portkey.ai/configs) to define how requests should be routed. A basic config looks like:

```json
{
 "provider":"@openai-key-abc123"
}
```

For production setups, you can add fallbacks, load balancing, and conditional routing here.
</Step>

<Step title="Generate Your Portkey API Key">
Go to [API Keys](https://app.portkey.ai/api-keys) to create a new API key. Attach your config as the default routing config, and you'll get an API key that routes to your configured providers.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Complete Integration Example

Here's a full example showing how to set up a Strands agent with Portkey integration:

```python [expandable]
from strands import Agent
from strands.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from strands_tools import calculator, web_search
from portkey_ai import PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL

# Initialize model through Portkey
model = OpenAIModel(
    client_args={
        "api_key": "YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        "base_url": PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL
    },
    model_id="gpt-4o",
    params={
        "max_tokens": 1000,
        "temperature": 0.7,
    }
)

# Create agent with tools (unchanged from standard Strands usage)
agent = Agent(
    model=model,
    tools=[calculator, web_search]
)

# Use the agent (unchanged from standard Strands usage)
response = agent("Calculate the compound interest on $10,000 at 5% for 10 years, then search for current inflation rates")
print(response)
```

The agent will automatically use both tools as needed, and every step will be logged in your Portkey dashboard with full request/response details, timing, and token usage.

## Production Features

### 1. Enhanced Observability

Portkey provides comprehensive visibility into your agent's behavior without requiring any code changes.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Request Tracing">
Track the complete execution flow of your agents with hierarchical traces that show:

- **LLM calls**: Every request to language models with full payloads
- **Tool invocations**: Which tools were called, with what parameters, and their responses
- **Decision points**: How the agent chose between different tools or approaches
- **Performance metrics**: Latency, token usage, and cost for each step

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/product/product-11-1.webp"/>
</Frame>

```python {11}
from strands import Agent
from strands.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from strands_tools import calculator
from portkey_ai import PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL, createHeaders

model = OpenAIModel(
    client_args={
        "api_key": "YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        "base_url": PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
        # Add trace ID to group related requests
        "default_headers": createHeaders(trace_id="user_session_123")
    },
    model_id="gpt-4o",
    params={"temperature": 0.7}
)

agent = Agent(model=model, tools=[calculator])
response = agent("What's 15% of 2,847?")
```

All requests from this agent will be grouped under the same trace, making it easy to analyze the complete interaction flow.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Custom Metadata">
Add business context to your agent runs for better filtering and analysis:

```python {8-13}
from portkey_ai import createHeaders

model = OpenAIModel(
    client_args={
        "api_key": "YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        "base_url": PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
        "default_headers": createHeaders(
            trace_id="customer_support_bot",
            metadata={
                "agent_type": "customer_support",
                "user_tier": "premium",
                "session_id": "sess_789",
                "department": "billing"
            }
        )
    },
    model_id="gpt-4o",
    params={"temperature": 0.3}  # Lower temperature for support tasks
)
```

This metadata appears in your Portkey dashboard, allowing you to filter logs and analyze performance by user type, session, or any custom dimension.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Real-time Monitoring">
Monitor your agents in production with built-in dashboards that track:

- **Success rates**: Percentage of successful agent completions
- **Average latency**: Response times across different agent types
- **Token usage**: Track consumption and costs across models
- **Error patterns**: Common failure modes and their frequency

All metrics can be segmented by the metadata you provide, giving you insights like "premium user agents have 15% higher success rates" or "billing department queries take 2x longer on average."
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Reliability & Fallbacks

When running agents in production, things can go wrong - API rate limits, network issues, or provider outages. Portkey's reliability features ensure your agents keep running smoothly even when problems occur.

It's simple to enable fallback in your Strands Agents by using a Portkey Config that you can attach at runtime or directly to your Portkey API key. Here's an example of attaching a Config at runtime:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Automatic Fallbacks">
Configure multiple providers so your agents keep working even when one provider fails:

```python {7-18}
from portkey_ai import createHeaders

model = OpenAIModel(
    client_args={
        "api_key": "YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        "base_url": PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
        "default_headers": createHeaders(
            config={
                "strategy": {
                    "mode": "fallback",
                    "on_status_codes": [429, 503, 502]  # Rate limits and server errors
                },
                "targets": [
                    { "provider":"@openai-key-primary" },   # Try OpenAI first
                    { "provider":"@anthropic-key-backup" }  # Fall back to Claude
                ]
            }
        )
    },
    model_id="gpt-4o",  # Will map to equivalent models on each provider
    params={"temperature": 0.7}
)
```

If OpenAI returns a rate limit error (429), Portkey automatically retries the request with Anthropic's Claude, using default model mappings.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Load Balancing">
Distribute requests across multiple API keys to stay within rate limits:

```python {7-15}
from portkey_ai import createHeaders

model = OpenAIModel(
    client_args={
        "api_key": "YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        "base_url": PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
        "default_headers": createHeaders(
            config={
                "strategy": {"mode": "loadbalance"},
                "targets": [
                    { "provider":"@openai-key-1", "weight": 70 },
                    { "provider":"@openai-key-2", "weight": 30 }
                ]
            }
        )
    },
    model_id="gpt-4o",
    params={"temperature": 0.7}
)
```

Requests will be distributed 70/30 across your two OpenAI keys, helping you maximize throughput without hitting individual key limits.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Conditional Routing">
Route requests to different providers/models based on custom logic (like metadata, input content, or user attributes) using Portkey's Conditional Routing feature.

See the [Conditional Routing documentation](/product/ai-gateway/conditional-routing) for full guidance and advanced examples.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### 3. LLM Interoperability

Access 1,600+ models through the same Strands interface by changing just the provider configuration:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Using Anthropic">
```python
from portkey_ai import createHeaders

# Use Claude instead of GPT-4
model = OpenAIModel(
    client_args={
        "api_key": "YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        "base_url": PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
        "default_headers": createHeaders(
            provider="@anthropic", # Your Portkey provider
        )
    },
    model_id="claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",  # Claude model ID
    params={"max_tokens": 1000, "temperature": 0.7}
)

# Agent code remains exactly the same
agent = Agent(model=model, tools=[calculator])
response = agent("Explain quantum computing in simple terms")
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Using Multiple Providers in One Agent">
```python
# Create different model instances for different tasks
reasoning_model = OpenAIModel(
    client_args={
        "api_key": "YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        "base_url": PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
        "default_headers": createHeaders(provider="@openai-key")
    },
    model_id="gpt-4o",
    params={"temperature": 0.1}  # Low temperature for reasoning
)

creative_model = OpenAIModel(
    client_args={
        "api_key": "YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        "base_url": PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
        "default_headers": createHeaders(provider="@gemini-key")
    },
    model_id="gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
    params={"temperature": 0.8}  # Higher temperature for creativity
)

# Use different models for different agent types
reasoning_agent = Agent(model=reasoning_model, tools=[calculator])
creative_agent = Agent(model=creative_model, tools=[])
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

Portkey provides access to LLMs from providers including:

- OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, etc.)
- Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, etc.)
- Mistral AI (Mistral Large, Mistral Medium, etc.)
- Google Vertex AI (Gemini 1.5 Pro, etc.)
- Cohere (Command, Command-R, etc.)
- AWS Bedrock (Claude, Titan, etc.)
- Local/Private Models

### 4. Guardrails for Safe Agents

Guardrails ensure your Strands agents operate safely and respond appropriately in all situations.

**Why Use Guardrails?**

Strands agents can experience various failure modes:
- Generating harmful or inappropriate content
- Leaking sensitive information like PII
- Hallucinating incorrect information
- Generating outputs in incorrect formats

Portkey's guardrails can:
- Detect and redact PII in both inputs and outputs
- Filter harmful or inappropriate content
- Validate response formats against schemas
- Check for hallucinations against ground truth
- Apply custom business logic and rules

## Advanced Configuration

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Environment-Specific Settings">
Configure different behavior for development, staging, and production:

```python [expandable]
import os
from portkey_ai import createHeaders

def create_model(environment="production"):
    if environment == "development":
        # Use faster, cheaper models for development
        headers = createHeaders(
            config={"targets": [{"provider":"@openai-dev-key"}]},
            metadata={"environment": "dev"}
        )
        model_id = "gpt-4o-mini"
        params = {"temperature": 0.5, "max_tokens": 500}

    elif environment == "production":
        # Use high-performance models with fallbacks for production
        headers = createHeaders(
            config={
                "strategy": {"mode": "fallback"},
                "targets": [
                    {"provider":"@openai-prod-key"},
                    {"provider":"@anthropic-prod-key"}
                ]
            },
            metadata={"environment": "prod"}
        )
        model_id = "gpt-4o"
        params = {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 2000}

    return OpenAIModel(
        client_args={
            "api_key": "YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
            "base_url": PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
            "default_headers": headers
        },
        model_id=model_id,
        params=params
    )

# Use environment-specific configuration
model = create_model(os.getenv("APP_ENV", "production"))
agent = Agent(model=model, tools=[calculator])
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Request-Level Overrides">
Override configuration for specific requests without changing the model:

```python [expandable]
from portkey_ai import createHeaders

model = OpenAIModel(
    client_args={
        "api_key": "YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        "base_url": PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL
    },
    model_id="gpt-4o",
    params={"temperature": 0.7}
)

# For high-priority requests, override to use faster/more reliable providers
agent = Agent(model=model, tools=[calculator])

# Normal request
response1 = agent("What's 2+2?")

# High-priority request with overrides (if your agent supports custom headers)
# This would require custom implementation in your agent wrapper
response2 = agent(
    "Critical calculation: What's the compound interest?",
    headers=createHeaders(
        config={"targets": [{"provider":"@premium-openai-key"}]},
        metadata={"priority": "high"}
    )
)
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

---

## Enterprise Governance

If you are using Strands inside your organization, you need to consider several governance aspects:
- **Cost Management**: Controlling and tracking AI spending across teams
- **Access Control**: Managing which teams can use specific models
- **Usage Analytics**: Understanding how AI is being used across the organization
- **Security & Compliance**: Maintaining enterprise security standards
- **Reliability**: Ensuring consistent service across all users


### Centralized Key Management
Instead of distributing raw API keys to developers, use Portkey API keys that you can control centrally:

```python
# Developers use Portkey API keys (not raw provider keys)
model = OpenAIModel(
    client_args={
        "api_key": "pk-team-frontend-xyz123",  # Team-specific Portkey key
        "base_url": PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL
    },
    model_id="gpt-4o",
    params={"temperature": 0.7}
)
```

You can:
- **Rotate provider keys** without updating any code
- **Set spending limits** per team or API key
- **Control model access** (which teams can use which models)
- **Monitor usage** across all teams and projects
- **Revoke access** instantly if needed

### Usage Analytics & Budgets
Track and control AI spending across your organization:

- **Per-team budgets**: Set monthly spending limits for different teams
- **Model usage analytics**: See which teams are using which models most
- **Cost attribution**: Understand costs by project, team, or user
- **Usage alerts**: Get notified when teams approach their limits

All of this works automatically with your existing Strands agents—no code changes required.

### Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Import Errors">
**Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError` when importing Portkey components

**Solution**: Ensure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
pip install -U strands-agents strands-agents-tools openai portkey-ai
```

Verify versions are compatible:
```python
import strands
import portkey_ai
print(f"Strands: {strands.__version__}")
print(f"Portkey: {portkey_ai.__version__}")
```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication Errors">
**Problem**: `AuthenticationError` when making requests

**Solution**: Verify your Portkey API key and provider setup: Verify your Portkey API key and provider setup. Test your Portkey API key directly and check for common issues such as wrong API key format, misconfigured provider, and missing config attachments.
```python
# Test your Portkey API key directly
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY")
response = portkey.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "test"}],
    model="gpt-4o"
)
print(response)
```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rate Limiting">

**Problem**: Hitting rate limits despite having fallbacks configured

**Solution**: Check your fallback configuration:
```python
# Ensure fallbacks are configured for rate limit status codes
headers = createHeaders(
    config={
        "strategy": {
            "mode": "fallback",
            "on_status_codes": [429, 503, 502, 504]
        },
        "targets": [
            {"provider":"@primary-key"},
            {"provider":"@backup-key"}
        ]
    }
)
```

Also verify that your backup providers have sufficient quota.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Model Compatibility">

**Problem**: Model not found or unsupported model errors

**Solution**: Check that your model ID is correct for the provider:
```python
# OpenAI models
model_id = "gpt-4o"  # Correct
model_id = "gpt-4-turbo"  # Correct

# Anthropic models
model_id = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"  # Correct
model_id = "claude-3-sonnet"  # Wrong format

# Use provider-specific model IDs, not generic names
```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing Traces/Logs">

**Problem**: Not seeing traces or logs in Portkey dashboard

**Solution**: Verify your requests are going through Portkey:
```python
# Check that base_url is set correctly
print(model.client.base_url)  # Should be https://api.portkey.ai/v1

# Add trace IDs for easier debugging
headers = createHeaders(
    trace_id="debug-session-123",
    metadata={"debug": "true"}
)
```

Also check the Logs section in your Portkey dashboard and filter by your metadata.
  </Accordion>
