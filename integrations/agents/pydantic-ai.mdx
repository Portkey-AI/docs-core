## Introduction

PydanticAI is a Python agent framework designed to make it less painful to build production-grade applications with Generative AI. It brings the same ergonomic design and developer experience to GenAI that FastAPI brought to web development.

Portkey enhances PydanticAI with production-readiness features, turning your experimental agents into robust systems by providing:

- **Complete observability** of every agent step, tool use, and interaction
- **Built-in reliability** with fallbacks, retries, and load balancing
- **Cost tracking and optimization** to manage your AI spend
- **Access to 1600+ LLMs** through a single integration
- **Guardrails** to keep agent behavior safe and compliant
- **OpenTelemetry integration** for comprehensive monitoring

### Installation & Setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the required packages">
```bash
pip install -U pydantic-ai openai
```
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Portkey Client">
Since Portkey is OpenAI SDK compatible, you can use the standard OpenAI client with Portkey's gateway URL:

```python
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

# Set up Portkey client using OpenAI SDK
portkey_client = AsyncOpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.portkey.ai/v1"
)
```
</Step>

<Step title="Connect to PydanticAI">
After setting up your Portkey client, integrate it with PydanticAI:

```python
# Connect Portkey client to a PydanticAI model
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIModel(
        model_name="@openai-team-1/gpt-4o",  # Use Portkey's model format
        provider=OpenAIProvider(openai_client=portkey_client),
    ),
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant."
)
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Basic Agent Implementation

Let's create a simple structured output agent with PydanticAI and Portkey. This agent will respond to a query about Formula 1 and return structured data:

```python
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

# Set up Portkey client
portkey_client = AsyncOpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.portkey.ai/v1"
)

# Define structured output using Pydantic
class F1GrandPrix(BaseModel):
    gp_name: str = Field(description="Grand Prix name, e.g. `Emilia Romagna Grand Prix`")
    year: int = Field(description="The year of the Grand Prix")
    constructor_winner: str = Field(description="The winning constructor of the Grand Prix")
    podium: list[str] = Field(description="Names of the podium drivers (1st, 2nd, 3rd)")

# Create the agent with structured output type
f1_gp_agent = Agent[None, F1GrandPrix](
    model=OpenAIModel(
        model_name="@openai-team-1/gpt-4o",
        provider=OpenAIProvider(openai_client=portkey_client),
    ),
    output_type=F1GrandPrix,
    system_prompt="Assist the user by providing data about the specified Formula 1 Grand Prix"
)

# Run the agent
async def main():
    result = await f1_gp_agent.run("Las Vegas 2023")
    print(result.output)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

The output will be a structured `F1GrandPrix` object with all fields properly typed and validated:

```json
gp_name='Las Vegas Grand Prix'
year=2023
constructor_winner='Red Bull Racing'
podium=['Max Verstappen', 'Charles Leclerc', 'Sergio PÃ©rez']
```

You can also use the synchronous API if preferred:

```python
result = f1_gp_agent.run_sync("Las Vegas 2023")
print(result.output)
```

## Advanced Features

### Using Portkey Headers for Enhanced Features

When you need additional Portkey features like tracing, metadata, or configs, you can add headers to your client:

```python
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

# Set up Portkey client with additional features
portkey_client = AsyncOpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.portkey.ai/v1",
    default_headers={
        "x-portkey-trace-id": "f1-data-request",
        "x-portkey-metadata": '{"app_env": "production", "_user": "user_123"}',
        "x-portkey-config": "your-config-id"
    }
)

# Create agent with enhanced Portkey features
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIModel(
        model_name="@openai-team-1/gpt-4o",
        provider=OpenAIProvider(openai_client=portkey_client),
    ),
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant."
)
```

### Working with Images

PydanticAI supports multimodal inputs including images. Here's how to use Portkey with a vision model:

```python
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from pydantic_ai import Agent, ImageUrl
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

# Set up Portkey client
portkey_client = AsyncOpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.portkey.ai/v1",
    default_headers={"x-portkey-trace-id": "vision-request"}
)

# Create a vision-capable agent
vision_agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIModel(
        model_name="@openai-team-1/gpt-4o",  # Vision-capable model
        provider=OpenAIProvider(openai_client=portkey_client),
    ),
    system_prompt="Analyze images and provide detailed descriptions."
)

# Process an image
result = vision_agent.run_sync([
    'What company is this logo from?',
    ImageUrl(url='https://iili.io/3Hs4FMg.png'),
])
print(result.output)
```

Visit your Portkey dashboard to see detailed logs of this image analysis request, including token usage and costs.

### Tools and Tool Calls

PydanticAI provides a powerful tools system that integrates seamlessly with Portkey. Here's how to create an agent with tools:

```python
import random
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

# Set up Portkey client
portkey_client = AsyncOpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.portkey.ai/v1",
    default_headers={"x-portkey-trace-id": "dice-game-session"}
)

# Create an agent with dependency injection (player name)
dice_agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIModel(
        model_name="@openai-team-1/gpt-4o",
        provider=OpenAIProvider(openai_client=portkey_client),
    ),
    deps_type=str,  # Dependency type (player name as string)
    system_prompt=(
        "You're a dice game host. Roll the die and see if it matches "
        "the user's guess. If so, tell them they're a winner. "
        "Use the player's name in your response."
    ),
)

# Define a plain tool (no context needed)
@dice_agent.tool_plain
def roll_die() -> str:
    """Roll a six-sided die and return the result."""
    return str(random.randint(1, 6))

# Define a tool that uses the dependency
@dice_agent.tool
def get_player_name(ctx: RunContext[str]) -> str:
    """Get the player's name."""
    return ctx.deps

# Run the agent
dice_result = dice_agent.run_sync('My guess is 4', deps='Anne')
print(dice_result.output)
```

<Info>
Portkey logs each tool call separately, allowing you to analyze the full execution path of your agent, including both LLM calls and tool invocations.
</Info>

### Multi-agent Applications

PydanticAI excels at creating multi-agent systems where agents can call each other. Here's how to integrate Portkey with a multi-agent setup:

This multi-agent system uses three specialized agents:
`search_agent` - Orchestrates the flow and validates flight selections
`extraction_agent` - Extracts structured flight data from raw text
`seat_preference_agent` - Interprets user's seat preferences

With Portkey integration, you get:

- Unified tracing across all three agents
- Token and cost tracking for the entire workflow
- Ability to set usage limits across the entire system
- Observability of both AI and human interaction points

Here's a diagram of how these agents interact:

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[START] --> B[search agent]

Portkey preserves all the type safety of PydanticAI while adding production monitoring and reliability.

## Production Features

### 1. Enhanced Observability

Portkey provides comprehensive observability for your PydanticAI agents, helping you understand exactly what's happening during each execution.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Traces">
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/product/product-11-1.webp"/>
</Frame>

Traces provide a hierarchical view of your agent's execution, showing the sequence of LLM calls, tool invocations, and state transitions.

```python
# Add trace_id to enable hierarchical tracing in Portkey
portkey_client = AsyncOpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.portkey.ai/v1",
    default_headers={"x-portkey-trace-id": "unique-session-id"}
)
```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Logs">
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/product/product-2.avif"/>
</Frame>

Portkey logs every interaction with LLMs, including:

- Complete request and response payloads
- Latency and token usage metrics
- Cost calculations
- Tool calls and function executions

All logs can be filtered by metadata, trace IDs, models, and more, making it easy to debug specific agent runs.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Metrics & Dashboards">
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/product/dashboard.png"/>
</Frame>

Portkey provides built-in dashboards that help you:

- Track cost and token usage across all agent runs
- Analyze performance metrics like latency and success rates
- Identify bottlenecks in your agent workflows
- Compare different agent configurations and LLMs

You can filter and segment all metrics by custom metadata to analyze specific agent types, user groups, or use cases.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Metadata Filtering">
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/metadata.png" alt="Analytics with metadata filters" />
</Frame>

Add custom metadata to your PydanticAI agent calls to enable powerful filtering and segmentation:

```python
portkey_client = AsyncOpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.portkey.ai/v1",
    default_headers={
        "x-portkey-metadata": '{"agent_type": "weather_agent", "environment": "production", "_user": "user_123", "request_source": "mobile_app"}'
    }
)
```

This metadata can be used to filter logs, traces, and metrics on the Portkey dashboard, allowing you to analyze specific agent runs, users, or environments.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. OpenTelemetry Integration

For comprehensive monitoring and observability, Portkey supports OpenTelemetry integration through various libraries:

```python
import openlit

# Initialize OpenLit with Portkey's OTEL endpoint
openlit.init(
    otlp_endpoint="https://api.portkey.ai/v1/otel",
    otlp_headers={
        "x-portkey-api-key": "YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY"
    }
)

# Your PydanticAI agents will now send telemetry data to Portkey
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

portkey_client = AsyncOpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.portkey.ai/v1"
)

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIModel(
        model_name="@openai-team-1/gpt-4o",
        provider=OpenAIProvider(openai_client=portkey_client),
    ),
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant."
)
```

### 3. Reliability - Keep Your Agents Running Smoothly

When running agents in production, things can go wrong - API rate limits, network issues, or provider outages. Portkey's reliability features ensure your agents keep running smoothly even when problems occur.

It's simple to enable fallback in your PydanticAI agents by using a Portkey Config:

```python
from openai import AsyncOpenAI

# Create Portkey client with fallback config
portkey_client = AsyncOpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.portkey.ai/v1",
    default_headers={
        "x-portkey-config": "your-fallback-config-id"
    }
)
```

This configuration will automatically try Claude if the GPT-4o request fails, ensuring your agent can continue operating.

<CardGroup cols="2">
  <Card title="Automatic Retries" icon="rotate" href="../../product/ai-gateway/automatic-retries">
    Handles temporary failures automatically. If an LLM call fails, Portkey will retry the same request for the specified number of times - perfect for rate limits or network blips.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Request Timeouts" icon="clock" href="../../product/ai-gateway/request-timeouts">
    Prevent your agents from hanging. Set timeouts to ensure you get responses (or can fail gracefully) within your required timeframes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Conditional Routing" icon="route" href="../../product/ai-gateway/conditional-routing">
    Send different requests to different providers. Route complex reasoning to GPT-4, creative tasks to Claude, and quick responses to Gemini based on your needs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fallbacks" icon="shield" href="../../product/ai-gateway/fallbacks">
    Keep running even if your primary provider fails. Automatically switch to backup providers to maintain availability.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Load Balancing" icon="scale-balanced" href="../../product/ai-gateway/load-balancing">
    Spread requests across multiple API keys or providers. Great for high-volume agent operations and staying within rate limits.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 4. Guardrails for Safe Agents

Guardrails ensure your PydanticAI agents operate safely and respond appropriately in all situations.

**Why Use Guardrails?**

PydanticAI agents can experience various failure modes:
- Generating harmful or inappropriate content
- Leaking sensitive information like PII
- Hallucinating incorrect information
- Generating outputs in incorrect formats

While PydanticAI provides type safety for outputs, Portkey's guardrails add additional protections for both inputs and outputs.

**Implementing Guardrails**

```python
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

# Create Portkey client with guardrails
portkey_client = AsyncOpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.portkey.ai/v1",
    default_headers={
        "x-portkey-config": "your-guardrails-config-id"
    }
)

# Create agent with Portkey-enabled client
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIModel(
        model_name="@openai-team-1/gpt-4o",
        provider=OpenAIProvider(openai_client=portkey_client),
    ),
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant."
)
```

Portkey's guardrails can:
- Detect and redact PII in both inputs and outputs
- Filter harmful or inappropriate content
- Validate response formats against schemas
- Check for hallucinations against ground truth
- Apply custom business logic and rules

### 5. User Tracking with Metadata

Track individual users through your PydanticAI agents using Portkey's metadata system.

**What is Metadata in Portkey?**

Metadata allows you to associate custom data with each request, enabling filtering, segmentation, and analytics. The special `_user` field is specifically designed for user tracking.

```python
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

# Configure client with user tracking
portkey_client = AsyncOpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.portkey.ai/v1",
    default_headers={
        "x-portkey-metadata": '{"_user": "user_123", "user_tier": "premium", "user_company": "Acme Corp", "session_id": "abc-123"}'
    }
)

# Create agent with Portkey client
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIModel(
        model_name="@openai-team-1/gpt-4o",
        provider=OpenAIProvider(openai_client=portkey_client),
    ),
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant."
)
```

**Filter Analytics by User**

With metadata in place, you can filter analytics by user and analyze performance metrics on a per-user basis:

### 6. Caching for Efficient Agents

Implement caching to make your PydanticAI agents more efficient and cost-effective:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Simple Caching">
```python
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

# Configure Portkey client with simple caching
portkey_client = AsyncOpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.portkey.ai/v1",
    default_headers={
        "x-portkey-config": "your-simple-cache-config-id"
    }
)

# Create agent with cached LLM calls
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIModel(
        model_name="@openai-team-1/gpt-4o",
        provider=OpenAIProvider(openai_client=portkey_client),
    ),
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant."
)
```

Simple caching performs exact matches on input prompts, caching identical requests to avoid redundant model executions.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Semantic Caching">
```python
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

# Configure Portkey client with semantic caching
portkey_client = AsyncOpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.portkey.ai/v1",
    default_headers={
        "x-portkey-config": "your-semantic-cache-config-id"
    }
)

# Create agent with semantically cached LLM calls
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIModel(
        model_name="@openai-team-1/gpt-4o",
        provider=OpenAIProvider(openai_client=portkey_client),
    ),
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant."
)
```

Semantic caching considers the contextual similarity between input requests, caching responses for semantically similar inputs.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 7. Model Interoperability

PydanticAI supports multiple LLM providers, and Portkey extends this capability by providing access to over 200 LLMs through a unified interface. You can easily switch between different models without changing your core agent logic:

```python
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

# OpenAI with Portkey
portkey_openai = AsyncOpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.portkey.ai/v1"
)

# Anthropic with Portkey
portkey_anthropic = AsyncOpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.portkey.ai/v1"
)

# Create agents with different models
openai_agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIModel(
        model_name="@openai-team-1/gpt-4o",
        provider=OpenAIProvider(openai_client=portkey_openai),
    ),
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant."
)

anthropic_agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIModel(
        model_name="@anthropic-team-1/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
        provider=OpenAIProvider(openai_client=portkey_anthropic),
    ),
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant."
)

# Choose which agent to use based on your needs
active_agent = openai_agent  # or anthropic_agent

result = active_agent.run_sync("Tell me about quantum computing.")
print(result.output)
```

Portkey provides access to LLMs from providers including:

- OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, etc.)
- Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, etc.)
- Mistral AI (Mistral Large, Mistral Medium, etc.)
- Google Vertex AI (Gemini 1.5 Pro, etc.)
- Cohere (Command, Command-R, etc.)
- AWS Bedrock (Claude, Titan, etc.)
- Local/Private Models

## Set Up Enterprise Governance for PydanticAI

**Why Enterprise Governance?**
If you are using PydanticAI inside your organization, you need to consider several governance aspects:
- **Cost Management**: Controlling and tracking AI spending across teams
- **Access Control**: Managing which teams can use specific models
- **Usage Analytics**: Understanding how AI is being used across the organization
- **Security & Compliance**: Maintaining enterprise security standards
- **Reliability**: Ensuring consistent service across all users

Portkey adds a comprehensive governance layer to address these enterprise needs. Let's implement these controls step by step.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create API Key with Config">
Since Portkey now uses the model format like `@team-name/model-name`, you can specify your team and model directly without needing virtual keys. Create a Portkey API key with an attached config:

1. Go to [API Keys](https://app.portkey.ai/api-keys) in Portkey and Create new API key
2. Optionally attach a config for advanced routing, fallbacks, and reliability features
3. Generate and save your API key

<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/api-key.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Model Access">
Use Portkey's model naming format to specify which team/provider can access which models:

```python
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

# Configure Portkey client with team-specific model access
portkey_client = AsyncOpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.portkey.ai/v1"
)

# Create agent with team-specific model
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIModel(
        model_name="@engineering-team/gpt-4o",  # Team-specific model access
        provider=OpenAIProvider(openai_client=portkey_client),
    ),
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant."
)
```
</Step>

<Step title="Add Enhanced Features with Headers">
For additional governance features like tracing, metadata, and configs, add headers as needed:

```python
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

# Configure Portkey client with governance features
portkey_client = AsyncOpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.portkey.ai/v1",
    default_headers={
        "x-portkey-trace-id": "engineering-session",
        "x-portkey-metadata": '{"department": "engineering", "environment": "production"}',
        "x-portkey-config": "your-governance-config-id"
    }
)

# Create agent with governance controls
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIModel(
        model_name="@engineering-team/gpt-4o",
        provider=OpenAIProvider(openai_client=portkey_client),
    ),
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant."
)
```
</Step>
</Steps>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Step 1: Implement Budget Controls & Rate Limits">
### Step 1: Implement Budget Controls & Rate Limits

Create configs that enable granular control over LLM access at the team/department level. This helps you:
- Set up budget limits through usage tracking
- Prevent unexpected usage spikes using rate limits
- Track departmental spending

#### Setting Up Department-Specific Controls:
1. Navigate to [Configs](https://app.portkey.ai/configs) in Portkey dashboard
2. Create new config for each department with appropriate controls
3. Configure department-specific limits and routing

<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/config.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 2: Define Model Access Rules">
### Step 2: Define Model Access Rules

As your AI usage scales, controlling which teams can access specific models becomes crucial. Portkey's model naming format and configs provide this control layer with features like:

#### Access Control Features:
- **Model Restrictions**: Limit access to specific models using team prefixes
- **Data Protection**: Implement guardrails for sensitive data
- **Reliability Controls**: Add fallbacks and retry logic

#### Example Configuration:
Here's a basic configuration to route requests to OpenAI, specifically using GPT-4o for the engineering team:

```json
{
	"strategy": {
		"mode": "single"
	},
	"targets": [
		{
			"provider": "openai",
			"api_key": "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY",
			"override_params": {
				"model": "gpt-4o"
			}
		}
	]
}
```

  Create your config on the [Configs page](https://app.portkey.ai/configs) in your Portkey dashboard.

    <Note>
    Configs can be updated anytime to adjust controls without affecting running applications.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 3: Implement Access Controls">
    ### Step 3: Implement Access Controls

    Create team-specific API keys that automatically:
    - Track usage per user/team with metadata
    - Apply appropriate configs to route requests
    - Collect relevant metadata to filter logs
    - Enforce access permissions

    Create API keys through:
    - [Portkey App](https://app.portkey.ai/)
    - [API Key Management API](/api-reference/admin-api/control-plane/api-keys/create-api-key)

    Example using Python SDK:
    ```python
    from portkey_ai import Portkey

    portkey = Portkey(api_key="YOUR_ADMIN_API_KEY")

    api_key = portkey.api_keys.create(
        name="engineering-team",
        type="organisation",
        workspace_id="YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID",
        defaults={
            "config_id": "your-config-id",
            "metadata": {
                "environment": "production",
                "department": "engineering"
            }
        },
        scopes=["logs.view", "configs.read"]
    )
    ```

    For detailed key management instructions, see our [API Keys documentation](/api-reference/admin-api/control-plane/api-keys/create-api-key).
  </Accordion>
