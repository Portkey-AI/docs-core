### Installation & Setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the required packages">
```bash
pip install -U crewai portkey-ai
```
</Step>

<Step title="Generate API Key" icon="lock">
Create a Portkey API key with optional budget/rate limits from the [Portkey dashboard](https://app.portkey.ai/). You can also attach configurations for reliability, caching, and more to this key. More on this later.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure CrewAI with Portkey">
The integration is simple - you just need to update the LLM configuration in your CrewAI setup:

```python
from crewai import LLM
from portkey_ai import createHeaders, PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL

# Create an LLM instance with Portkey integration
gpt_llm = LLM(
    model="gpt-4o",
    base_url=PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
    api_key="dummy",
    extra_headers=createHeaders(
        api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        provider="@YOUR_LLM_PROVIDER",
        trace_id="unique-trace-id",               # Optional, for request tracing
    )
)

#Use them in your Crew Agents like this:

	@agent
	def lead_market_analyst(self) -> Agent:
		return Agent(
			config=self.agents_config['lead_market_analyst'],
			verbose=True,
			memory=False,
			llm=gpt_llm
		)

```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Production Features

### 1. Enhanced Observability

Portkey provides comprehensive observability for your CrewAI agents, helping you understand exactly what's happening during each execution.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Traces">
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/product/product-11-1.webp"/>
</Frame>

Traces provide a hierarchical view of your crew's execution, showing the sequence of LLM calls, tool invocations, and state transitions.

```python
# Add trace_id to enable hierarchical tracing in Portkey
portkey_llm = LLM(
    model="gpt-4o",
    base_url=PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
    api_key="dummy",
    extra_headers=createHeaders(
        api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        provider="@YOUR_OPENAI_PROVIDER",
        trace_id="unique-session-id"  # Add unique trace ID
    )
)
```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Logs">
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/product/product-2.avif"/>
</Frame>

Portkey logs every interaction with LLMs, including:

- Complete request and response payloads
- Latency and token usage metrics

- Identify bottlenecks in your agent workflows
- Compare different crew configurations and LLMs

You can filter and segment all metrics by custom metadata to analyze specific crew types, user groups, or use cases.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Metadata Filtering">
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/metadata.png" alt="Analytics with metadata filters" />
</Frame>

Add custom metadata to your CrewAI LLM configuration to enable powerful filtering and segmentation:

```python
portkey_llm = LLM(
    model="gpt-4o",
    base_url=PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
    api_key="dummy",
    extra_headers=createHeaders(
        api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        provider="@YOUR_OPENAI_PROVIDER",
        metadata={
            "crew_type": "research_crew",
            "environment": "production",
            "_user": "user_123",   # Special _user field for user analytics
            "request_source": "mobile_app"
        }
    )
)
```

This metadata can be used to filter logs, traces, and metrics on the Portkey dashboard, allowing you to analyze specific crew runs, users, or environments.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Reliability - Keep Your Crews Running Smoothly

When running crews in production, things can go wrong - API rate limits, network issues, or provider outages. Portkey's reliability features ensure your agents keep running smoothly even when problems occur.

It's simple to enable fallback in your CrewAI setup by using a Portkey Config:

```python
from crewai import LLM
from portkey_ai import createHeaders, PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL

# Create LLM with fallback configuration
portkey_llm = LLM(
    model="gpt-4o",
    max_tokens=1000,
    base_url=PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
    api_key="dummy",
    extra_headers=createHeaders(
        api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        config={
            "strategy": {
                "mode": "fallback"
            },
            "targets": [
                {
                    "provider": "openai",
                    "api_key": "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY",
                    "override_params": {"model": "gpt-4o"}
                },
                {
                    "provider": "anthropic",
                    "api_key": "YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY",
                    "override_params": {"model": "claude-3-opus-20240229"}
                }
            ]
        }
    )
)

# Use this LLM configuration with your agents
```

This configuration will automatically try Claude if the GPT-4o request fails, ensuring your crew can continue operating.

### 3. Prompting in CrewAI

Portkey's Prompt Engineering Studio helps you create, manage, and optimize the prompts used in your CrewAI agents. Instead of hardcoding prompts or instructions, use Portkey's prompt rendering API to dynamically fetch and apply your versioned prompts.

<Frame caption="Manage prompts in Portkey's Prompt Library">
![Prompt Playground Interface](/images/product/ai-gateway/ai-20.webp)
</Frame>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Prompt Playground">
Prompt Playground is a place to compare, test and deploy perfect prompts for your AI application. It's where you experiment with different models, test variables, compare outputs, and refine your prompt engineering strategy before deploying to production. It allows you to:

1. Iteratively develop prompts before using them in your agents
2. Test prompts with different variables and models
3. Compare outputs between different prompt versions
4. Collaborate with team members on prompt development

This visual environment makes it easier to craft effective prompts for each step in your CrewAI agents' workflow.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Using Prompt Templates">
The Prompt Render API retrieves your prompt templates with all parameters configured:

```python
from crewai import Agent, LLM
from portkey_ai import createHeaders, PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL, Portkey

# Initialize Portkey admin client
portkey_admin = Portkey(api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY")

# Retrieve prompt using the render API
prompt_data = portkey_client.prompts.render(
    prompt_id="YOUR_PROMPT_ID",
    variables={
        "agent_role": "Senior Research Scientist",
    }
)

backstory_agent_prompt=prompt_data.data.messages[0]["content"]


# Set up LLM with Portkey integration
portkey_llm = LLM(
    model="gpt-4o",
    base_url=PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
    api_key="dummy",
    extra_headers=createHeaders(
        api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        provider="@YOUR_OPENAI_PROVIDER"
    )
)

# Create agent using the rendered prompt
researcher = Agent(
    role="Senior Research Scientist",
    goal="Discover groundbreaking insights about the assigned topic",
    backstory=backstory_agent,  # Use the rendered prompt
    verbose=True,
    llm=portkey_llm
)
```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Prompt Versioning">
You can:
- Create multiple versions of the same prompt
- Compare performance between versions
- Roll back to previous versions if needed
- Specify which version to use in your code:

```python
# Use a specific prompt version
prompt_data = portkey_admin.prompts.render(
    prompt_id="YOUR_PROMPT_ID@version_number",
    variables={
        "agent_role": "Senior Research Scientist",
        "agent_goal": "Discover groundbreaking insights"
    }
)
```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Mustache Templating for variables">
Portkey prompts use Mustache-style templating for easy variable substitution:

```
You are a {{agent_role}} with expertise in {{domain}}.

Your mission is to {{agent_goal}} by leveraging your knowledge
and experience in the field.

Always maintain a {{tone}} tone and focus on providing {{focus_area}}.
```

When rendering, simply pass the variables:

```python
prompt_data = portkey_admin.prompts.render(
    prompt_id="YOUR_PROMPT_ID",
    variables={
        "agent_role": "Senior Research Scientist",
        "domain": "artificial intelligence",
        "agent_goal": "discover groundbreaking insights",

### 4. Guardrails for Safe Crews

Guardrails ensure your CrewAI agents operate safely and respond appropriately in all situations.

**Why Use Guardrails?**

CrewAI agents can experience various failure modes:
- Generating harmful or inappropriate content
- Leaking sensitive information like PII
- Hallucinating incorrect information
- Generating outputs in incorrect formats

Portkey's guardrails add protections for both inputs and outputs.

**Implementing Guardrails**

```python
from crewai import Agent, LLM
from portkey_ai import createHeaders, PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL

# Create LLM with guardrails
portkey_llm = LLM(
    model="gpt-4o",
    base_url=PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
    api_key="dummy",
    extra_headers=createHeaders(
        api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        provider="@YOUR_OPENAI_PROVIDER",
        config={
            "input_guardrails": ["guardrails-id-xxx", "guardrails-id-yyy"],
            "output_guardrails": ["guardrails-id-zzz"]
        }
    )
)

# Create agent with guardrailed LLM
researcher = Agent(
    role="Senior Research Scientist",
    goal="Discover groundbreaking insights about the assigned topic",
    backstory="You are an expert researcher with deep domain knowledge.",
    verbose=True,
    llm=portkey_llm
)
```

Portkey's guardrails can:
- Detect and redact PII in both inputs and outputs
- Filter harmful or inappropriate content
- Validate response formats against schemas
- Check for hallucinations against ground truth
- Apply custom business logic and rules

### 5. User Tracking with Metadata

Track individual users through your CrewAI agents using Portkey's metadata system.

**What is Metadata in Portkey?**

Metadata allows you to associate custom data with each request, enabling filtering, segmentation, and analytics. The special `_user` field is specifically designed for user tracking.

```python
from crewai import Agent, LLM
from portkey_ai import createHeaders, PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL

# Configure LLM with user tracking
portkey_llm = LLM(
    model="gpt-4o",
    base_url=PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
    api_key="dummy",
    extra_headers=createHeaders(
        api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        provider="@YOUR_OPENAI_PROVIDER",
        metadata={
            "_user": "user_123",  # Special _user field for user analytics
            "user_tier": "premium",
            "user_company": "Acme Corp",
            "session_id": "abc-123"
        }
    )
)

# Create agent with tracked LLM
researcher = Agent(
    role="Senior Research Scientist",
    goal="Discover groundbreaking insights about the assigned topic",
    backstory="You are an expert researcher with deep domain knowledge.",
    verbose=True,
    llm=portkey_llm
)
```

**Filter Analytics by User**

With metadata in place, you can filter analytics by user and analyze performance metrics on a per-user basis:

<Frame caption="Filter analytics by user">
  <img src="/images/metadata-filters.png"/>
</Frame>

This enables:
- Per-user cost tracking and budgeting
- Personalized user analytics
- Team or organization-level metrics
- Environment-specific monitoring (staging vs. production)

### 6. Caching for Efficient Crews

Implement caching to make your CrewAI agents more efficient and cost-effective:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Simple Caching">
```python
from crewai import Agent, LLM
from portkey_ai import createHeaders, PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL

# Configure LLM with simple caching
portkey_llm = LLM(
    model="gpt-4o",
    base_url=PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
    api_key="dummy",
    extra_headers=createHeaders(
        api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        provider="@YOUR_OPENAI_PROVIDER",
        config={
            "cache": {
                "mode": "simple"
            }
        }
    )
)

# Create agent with cached LLM
researcher = Agent(
    role="Senior Research Scientist",
    goal="Discover groundbreaking insights about the assigned topic",
    backstory="You are an expert researcher with deep domain knowledge.",
    verbose=True,
    llm=portkey_llm
)
```

Simple caching performs exact matches on input prompts, caching identical requests to avoid redundant model executions.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Semantic Caching">
```python
from crewai import Agent, LLM
from portkey_ai import createHeaders, PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL

# Configure LLM with semantic caching
portkey_llm = LLM(
    model="gpt-4o",
    base_url=PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
    api_key="dummy",
    extra_headers=createHeaders(
        api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        provider="@YOUR_OPENAI_PROVIDER",
        config={
            "cache": {
                "mode": "semantic"
            }
        }
    )
)

# Create agent with semantically cached LLM
researcher = Agent(
    role="Senior Research Scientist",
    goal="Discover groundbreaking insights about the assigned topic",
    backstory="You are an expert researcher with deep domain knowledge.",
    verbose=True,
    llm=portkey_llm
)
```

Semantic caching considers the contextual similarity between input requests, caching responses for semantically similar inputs.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 7. Model Interoperability

CrewAI supports multiple LLM providers, and Portkey extends this capability by providing access to over 200 LLMs through a unified interface. You can easily switch between different models without changing your core agent logic:

```python
from crewai import Agent, LLM
from portkey_ai import createHeaders, PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL

# Set up LLMs with different providers
openai_llm = LLM(
    model="gpt-4o",
    base_url=PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
    api_key="dummy",
    extra_headers=createHeaders(
        api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        provider="@YOUR_OPENAI_PROVIDER"
    )
)

anthropic_llm = LLM(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-latest",
    max_tokens=1000,
    base_url=PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
    api_key="dummy",
    extra_headers=createHeaders(
        api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
        provider="@YOUR_ANTHROPIC_PROVIDER"
    )
)

# Choose which LLM to use for each agent based on your needs
researcher = Agent(
    role="Senior Research Scientist",
    goal="Discover groundbreaking insights about the assigned topic",
    backstory="You are an expert researcher with deep domain knowledge.",
    verbose=True,
    llm=openai_llm  # Use anthropic_llm for Anthropic
)
```

Portkey provides access to LLMs from providers including:

- OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, etc.)
- Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, etc.)
- Mistral AI (Mistral Large, Mistral Medium, etc.)

    Yes! Portkey integrates seamlessly with existing CrewAI applications. You just need to update your LLM configuration code with the Portkey-enabled version. The rest of your agent and crew code remains unchanged.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Portkey work with all CrewAI features?">
    Portkey supports all CrewAI features, including agents, tools, human-in-the-loop workflows, and all task process types (sequential, hierarchical, etc.). It adds observability and reliability without limiting any of the framework's functionality.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I track usage across multiple agents in a crew?">
    Yes, Portkey allows you to use a consistent `trace_id` across multiple agents in a crew to track the entire workflow. This is especially useful for complex crews where you want to understand the full execution path across multiple agents.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I filter logs and traces for specific crew runs?">
    Portkey allows you to add custom metadata to your LLM configuration, which you can then use for filtering. Add fields like `crew_name`, `crew_type`, or `session_id` to easily find and analyze specific crew executions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use my own API keys with Portkey?">
    Yes! Portkey uses your own API keys for the various LLM providers. It securely stores them, allowing you to easily manage and rotate keys without changing your code.
