Zed is a next-generation code editor engineered for high-performance collaboration between developers and AI. Integrating Portkey with Zed allows you to secure, observe, and govern your LLM workflows with enterprise-grade control. This guide walks through setting up Portkey as the gateway for all your Zed requests, enabling centralized monitoring, caching, cost control, and compliance.

Why Integrate Portkey with Zed?

- **Unified AI Gateway** - Single interface for 1600+ LLMs with API key management. (not just OpenAI & Anthropic)
- **Centralized AI observability**: Real-time usage tracking for 40+ key metrics and logs for every request
- **Governance** - Real-time spend tracking, set budget limits and RBAC in your Zed setup
- **Security Guardrails** - PII detection, content filtering, and compliance controls

<Note>

# 1. Setting up Portkey
Portkey allows you to use 1600+ LLMs with your Zed setup, with minimal configuration required. Let's set up the core components in Portkey that you'll need for integration.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create Virtual Key">
Virtual Keys are Portkey's secure way to manage your LLM provider API keys. Think of them like disposable credit cards for your LLM API keys, providing essential controls like:
- Budget limits for API usage
- Rate limiting capabilities
- Secure API key storage

To create a virtual key:
Go to [Virtual Keys](https://app.portkey.ai/virtual-keys) in the Portkey App. Save and copy the virtual key ID

</Frame>

<Note>
Save your virtual key ID - you'll need it for the next step.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Create Default Config">

Configs in Portkey are JSON objects that define how your requests are routed. They help with implementing features like advanced routing, fallbacks, and retries.

We need to create a default config to route our requests to the virtual key created in Step 1.

To create your config:
1. Go to [Configs](https://app.portkey.ai/configs) in Portkey dashboard
2. Create new config with:
    ```json
    {
        "virtual_key": "YOUR_VIRTUAL_KEY_FROM_STEP1",
    }
    ```
3. Save and note the Config name for the next step

<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/config.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>

<Note>
This basic config connects to your virtual key. You can add more advanced portkey features later.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Portkey API Key">

Now create Portkey API key access point and attach the config you created in Step 2:

1. Go to [API Keys](https://app.portkey.ai/api-keys) in Portkey and Create new API key
2. Select your config from `Step 2`
3. Generate and save your API key

<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/api-key.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>

<Note>
Save your API key securely - you'll need it for Zed integration.
</Note>
</Step>
</Steps>

## 2. Integrated Portkey with Zed
<Note>
    You will need your Portkey API key created in [Step 1](#Setting-up-portkey) for this integration
</Note>

Portkey is an OpenAI compatible API, which means it can be easily integrated with zed without any changes to your setup. Here's how you do it

1. Open `Settings.json` in Zed using Command Palette (cmd-shift-p / ctrl-shift-p) and run `zed: open settings`
Add the following configuration to your `settings.json` file:
This configuration will allow you to use Portkey's GPT-4o model in Zed. You can change the model according to your virtual key setup in step 1.ll power of GPT-4o.
 **Configure Zed**
   Update your `settings.json` in Zed:
   ```json
   {
     "language_models": {
       "openai": {
         "api_url": "https://api.portkey.ai/v1",
         "available_models": [
           {
             "name": "gpt-4o", // choose the model you want to use according to your virtual key setup
             "display_name": "Portkey-Model", // you can change this to any name
             "max_tokens": 131072 // this is a required field
           }
         ],
         "version": "1"
       }
     }
   }
   ```


3. **Add API Key to Zed**
   - Open Command Palette (cmd-shift-p / ctrl-shift-p)
   - Run "assistant: show configuration"
   - Add your Portkey API key under OpenAI configuration


# 3. Set Up Enterprise Governance for Zed

**Why Enterprise Governance?**
If you are using Zed inside your orgnaization, you need to consider several governance aspects:
- **Cost Management**: Controlling and tracking AI spending across teams
- **Access Control**: Managing which teams can use specific models
- **Usage Analytics**: Understanding how AI is being used across the organization
- **Security & Compliance**: Maintaining enterprise security standards
- **Reliability**: Ensuring consistent service across all users

Portkey adds a comprehensive governance layer to address these enterprise needs. Let's implement these controls step by step.

**Enterprise Implementation Guide**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Step 1: Implement Budget Controls & Rate Limits">
### Step 1: Implement Budget Controls & Rate Limits

Virtual Keys enable granular control over LLM access at the team/department level. This helps you:
- Set up [budget limits](/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys/budget-limits)
- Prevent unexpected usage spikes using Rate limits
- Track departmental spending

#### Setting Up Department-Specific Controls:
1. Navigate to [Virtual Keys](https://app.portkey.ai/virtual-keys) in Portkey dashboard
2. Create new Virtual Key for each department with budget limits and rate limits
3. Configure department-specific limits

<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/openai/virtual-key-2.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 2: Define Model Access Rules">
### Step 2: Define Model Access Rules

As your AI usage scales, controlling which teams can access specific models becomes crucial. Portkey Configs provide this control layer with features like:

#### Access Control Features:
- **Model Restrictions**: Limit access to specific models
- **Data Protection**: Implement guardrails for sensitive data
- **Reliability Controls**: Add fallbacks and retry logic

#### Example Configuration:
Here's a basic configuration to route requests to OpenAI, specifically using GPT-4o:

```json
{
	"strategy": {
		"mode": "single"
	},
	"targets": [
		{
			"virtual_key": "YOUR_OPENAI_VIRTUAL_KEY",
			"override_params": {
				"model": "gpt-4o"
			}
		}
	]
}
```

Create your config on the [Configs page](https://app.portkey.ai/configs) in your Portkey dashboard. You'll need the config ID for connecting to Zed's setup.


<Note>
Configs can be updated anytime to adjust controls without affecting running applications.
</Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 3: Implement Access Controls">
### Step 3: Implement Access Controls

Create User-specific API keys that automatically:
- Track usage per user/team with the help of virtual keys
- Apply appropriate configs to route requests
- Collect relevant metadata to filter logs
- Enforce access permissions


Create API keys through:
- [Portkey App](https://app.portkey.ai/)
- [API Key Management API](/api-reference/admin-api/control-plane/api-keys/create-api-key)


Example using Python SDK:
```python
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(api_key="YOUR_ADMIN_API_KEY")

api_key = portkey.api_keys.create(
    name="engineering-team",
    type="organisation",
    workspace_id="YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID",
    defaults={
        "config_id": "your-config-id",
        "metadata": {
            "environment": "production",
            "department": "engineering"
        }
    },
    scopes=["logs.view", "configs.read"]
)
```

For detailed key management instructions, see our [API Keys documentation](/api-reference/admin-api/control-plane/api-keys/create-api-key).
