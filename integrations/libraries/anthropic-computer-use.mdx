# Portkey Features
Now that you have enterprise-grade Anthropic Computer Use setup, let's explore the comprehensive features Portkey provides to ensure secure, efficient, and cost-effective AI-assisted development.

### 1. Comprehensive Metrics
Using Portkey you can track 40+ key metrics including cost, token usage, response time, and performance across all your LLM providers in real time. Filter these metrics by developer, team, or project using custom metadata.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/integrations/observability.png" width="600"/>
</Frame>

### 2. Advanced Logs
Portkey's logging dashboard provides detailed logs for every request made by Anthropic Computer Use. These logs include:
- Complete request and response tracking
- Code context and generation metrics
- Developer attribution
- Cost breakdown per coding session

### 3. Unified Access to 250+ LLMs

Easily switch between 250+ LLMs for different coding tasks. Use GPT-4 for complex architecture decisions, Claude for detailed code reviews, or specialized models for specific languages - all through a single interface.

### 4. Advanced Metadata Tracking
Track coding patterns and productivity metrics with custom metadata:
- Language and framework usage
- Code generation vs completion tasks
- Time-of-day productivity patterns
- Project-specific metrics

# FAQs
<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="How do I track costs per developer?">
Portkey provides several ways to track developer costs:
- Use metadata tags to identify developers
- Set up developer-specific API keys
- View detailed analytics in the dashboard
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if a developer exceeds their budget?">
When a developer reaches their budget limit:
1. Further requests will be blocked
2. The developer and admin receive notifications
3. Coding history remains available
4. Admins can adjust limits as needed
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use Anthropic Computer Use with local or self-hosted models?">
Yes! Portkey supports local models through Ollama and other self-hosted solutions. Configure your local endpoint as a custom provider in Portkey and use it with Anthropic Computer Use just like any other provider.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I ensure code security with AI assistance?">
Portkey provides multiple security layers:
- Guardrails to prevent sensitive data exposure
