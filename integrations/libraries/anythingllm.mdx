While AnythingLLM delivers robust chat capabilities, Portkey adds essential enterprise controls for production deployments:

- Secure API Gateway - Unified interface for 250+ LLMs with centralized credential management
- 
- Cost Governance - Real-time spend tracking and budget enforcement
- 
- Security Guardrails - PII detection, content filtering, and compliance controls

# 1. Getting Started with Portkey


Portkey allows you to use 250+ LLMs with your Chat UI setup, with minimal configuration required. Let's set up the core components in Portkey that you'll need for integration.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create Virtual Key">
Virtual Keys are Portkey's secure way to manage your LLM provider API keys. Think of them like disposable credit cards for your LLM API keys, providing essential controls like:
- Budget limits for API usage
- Rate limiting capabilities
- Secure API key storage

To create a virtual key:
Go to [Virtual Keys](https://app.portkey.ai/virtual-keys) in Portkey App. Save and copy the virtual key ID

<img src="/images/integrations/openai/virtual-key-2.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>

<Note>
Save your virtual key ID - you'll need it for the next step.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Create Default Config">

Configs in Portkey are JSON objects that define how your requests are routed. They help with implementing features like advanced routing, fallbacks, and retries.

To create your config:
1. Go to [Configs](https://app.portkey.ai/configs) in Portkey dashboard
2. Create new config with:
    ```json
    {
        "virtual_key": "YOUR_VIRTUAL_KEY_FROM_STEP1",
    }
    ```
3. Save and note the Config name for the next step

<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/config.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>

<Note>
This basic config connects to your virtual key. You can add more advanced portkey features later.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Portkey API Key">

Now create Portkey API key access point and attach the config you created in Step 2:

1. Go to [API Keys](https://app.portkey.ai/api-keys) in Portkey
2. Create new API key
3. Select your config from `Step 2`
4. Generate and save your API key

<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/api-key.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>

<Note>
Save your API key securely - you'll need it for Chat UI integration and it cannot be viewed again after creation.
</Note>
</Step>
</Steps>





# 2. Integrate Portkey with AnythingLLM

Now that you have your Portkey components set up, let's connect them to AnythingLLM. Since Portkey provides OpenAI API compatibility, integration is straightforward and requires just a few configuration steps in your AnythingLLM interface.

### Prerequisites
- Completed Portkey setup from previous section
- Running AnythingLLM installation
- Your Portkey API key from `Step 3`

### Configure AnythingLLM

1. Launch your AnythingLLM application
2. Navigate to `Settings > AI Providers > LLM`
3. In the LLM Provider dropdown, select `Generic OpenAI`
4. Configure the following settings:
   - Base URL: `https://api.portkey.ai/v1`
   - API Key: Your Portkey API key from the setup
   - Chat Model: Your preferred model name (e.g., `gpt-4`, `claude-2`)
   - Token Context Window: Set based on your model's limits
   - Max Tokens: Configure according to your needs


You can monitor your requests and usage in the [Portkey Dashboard](https://app.portkey.ai/dashboard).

<Warning>
Make sure your virtual key has sufficient budget and rate limits for your expected usage. Also use the complete model name given by the provider.
</Warning>

# 3. Set Up Enterprise Governance for AnythingLLM

## Why Enterprise Governance?
While AnythingLLM provides excellent core functionality and data privacy compliance, enterprise deployments need additional layers of control and visibility. Organizations typically face challenges with:

- **Cost Management**: Controlling and tracking AI spending across teams
- **Access Control**: Managing which teams can use specific models
- **Usage Analytics**: Understanding how AI is being used across the organization
- **Security & Compliance**: Maintaining enterprise security standards
- **Reliability**: Ensuring consistent service across all users

Portkey adds a comprehensive governance layer to address these enterprise needs. Let's implement these controls step by step.

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Implement Budget Controls & Rate Limits

Virtual Keys enable granular control over LLM access at the team/department level. This helps you:
- Set up [budget limits]()
- Prevent unexpected usage spikes using Rate limits
- Track departmental spending

#### Setting Up Department-Specific Controls:
1. Navigate to [Virtual Keys](https://app.portkey.ai/virtual-keys) in Portkey dashboard
2. Create new Virtual Key for each department with budget limits and rate limits
3. Configure department-specific limits

<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/openai/virtual-key-2.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>

### Step 2: Define Model Access Rules

As your AnythingLLM deployment scales, controlling which teams can access specific models becomes crucial. Portkey Configs provide this control layer with features like:

#### Access Control Features:
- **Model Restrictions**: Limit access to specific models
- **Data Protection**: Implement guardrails for sensitive data
- **Reliability Controls**: Add fallbacks and retry logic

#### Example Configuration:
Here’s a basic configuration to route requests to OpenAI, specifically using GPT-4o:

```json
{
	"strategy": {
		"mode": "single"
	},
	"targets": [
		{
			"virtual_key": "YOUR_OPENAI_VIRTUAL_KEY",
			"override_params": {
				"model": "gpt-4o"
			}
		}
	]
}
```

Create your config on the [Configs page](https://app.portkey.ai/configs) in your Portkey dashboard. You'll need the config ID for connecting to AnythingLLM setup.


<Note>
Configs can be updated anytime to adjust controls without affecting running applications.
</Note>

### Step 3: Implement Access Controls

Create User-specific API keys that automatically:
- Track usage per user/team with the help of virtual keys
- Apply appropriate configs to route requests
- Collect relevant metadata to filter logs
- Enforce access permissions


Create API keys through:
- [Portkey App](https://app.portkey.ai/)
- [API Key Management API](/api-reference/admin-api/control-plane/api-keys/create-api-key)


Example using Python SDK:
```python
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(api_key="YOUR_ADMIN_API_KEY")

api_key = portkey.api_keys.create(
    name="engineering-team",
    type="organisation",
    workspace_id="YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID",
    defaults={
        "config_id": "your-config-id",
        "metadata": {
            "environment": "production",
            "department": "engineering"
        }
    },
    scopes=["logs.view", "configs.read"]
)
```

For detailed key management instructions, see our [API Keys documentation](/api-reference/admin-api/control-plane/api-keys/create-api-key).

### Step 4: Deploy & Monitor
After distributing API keys to your team members, your enterprise-ready AnythingLLM setup is ready to go. Each team member can now use their designated API keys with appropriate access levels and budget controls.
Apply your governance setup using the integration steps from earlier sections
Monitor usage in Portkey dashboard:
- Cost tracking by department
- Model usage patterns
- Request volumes
- Error rates
