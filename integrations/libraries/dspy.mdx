description: 'Integrate DSPy with Portkey for production-ready LLM pipelines'
---

DSPy is a framework for algorithmically optimizing language model prompts and weights.

Portkey's integration with DSPy makes your DSPy pipelines production-ready with detailed insights on costs & performance metrics for each run, and also makes your existing DSPy code work across 1600+ LLMs.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```sh
pip install -U dspy
```

### Setting up

Portkey integrates seamlessly with DSPy's new `LM` interface, allowing you to use 1600+ LLMs with detailed cost insights. Simply configure the LM with Portkey's gateway URL and your Portkey API key.

<Note>
Grab your Portkey API key from [here](https://app.portkey.ai/).
</Note>

```python
import dspy

# Set up your Portkey-enabled LM client
lm = dspy.LM(
    "openai/@YOUR_PROVIDER_SLUG/MODEL_NAME",
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    api_base="https://api.portkey.ai/v1"
)

# Configure DSPy to use the Portkey-enabled client
dspy.configure(lm=lm)
```

The model string follows the format: `openai/@PROVIDER_SLUG/MODEL_NAME` where:
- `@PROVIDER_SLUG` is your provider's slug in Portkey (found in Model Catalog)
- `MODEL_NAME` is the specific model you want to use

Example model strings:
- `openai/@openai-provider-slug/gpt-4o`
- `openai/@anthropic-provider-slug/claude-3-sonnet-20240320`
- `openai/@aws-bedrock-slug/anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0`

🎉 That's it! You're now ready to use Portkey with DSPy.

## Let's make your first Request

Here's a simple example demonstrating DSPy with Portkey integration:

<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IDdBoU9S_LAdueZkIcSx5F14wvjhKU3C?usp=sharing">
  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
</a>

```python
import dspy

# Set up the Portkey-enabled client
lm = dspy.LM(
    "openai/@openai-provider-slug/gpt-4o",
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    api_base="https://api.portkey.ai/v1"
)
dspy.configure(lm=lm)

# Simple completion
response = lm("Say this is a test!", temperature=0.7)
print(response)  # => ['This is a test!']
```

When you make a request using Portkey with DSPy, you can view detailed information about the request in the Portkey dashboard:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/libraries/dspy-logs.png" alt="Portkey Dashboard" width="375" />
</Frame>

* `Request Details`: Information about the specific request, including the model used, input, and output.
* `Metrics`: Performance metrics such as latency, token usage, and cost.
* `Logs`: Detailed logs of the request, including any errors or warnings.
* `Traces`: A visual representation of the request flow, especially useful for complex DSPy modules.

## Portkey Features with DSPy

### 1. Interoperability

Portkey's Unified API enables you to easily switch between **250**+ language models. Simply change the provider slug and model name in your model string:

<CodeGroup>

```python Switch between providers
# OpenAI GPT-4
lm_openai = dspy.LM(
    "openai/@openai-provider-slug/gpt-4o",
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    api_base="https://api.portkey.ai/v1"
)
dspy.configure(lm=lm_openai)

# Anthropic Claude
lm_anthropic = dspy.LM(
    "openai/@anthropic-provider-slug/claude-3-opus-20240229",
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    api_base="https://api.portkey.ai/v1"
)
dspy.configure(lm=lm_anthropic)

# AWS Bedrock
lm_bedrock = dspy.LM(
    "openai/@aws-bedrock-slug/anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0",
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    api_base="https://api.portkey.ai/v1"
)
dspy.configure(lm=lm_bedrock)
```

</CodeGroup>

### 2. Logs and Traces

Portkey provides detailed tracing for each request. This is especially useful for complex DSPy modules with multiple LLM calls. You can view these traces in the Portkey dashboard to understand the flow of your DSPy application.

  <img src="/images/libraries/dspy-traces.gif" alt="DSPy Traces" />
</Frame>

### 3. Metrics

Portkey's Observability suite helps you track key metrics like **cost** and **token** usage, which is crucial for managing the high cost of DSPy operations. The observability dashboard helps you track 40+ key metrics, giving you detailed insights into your DSPy runs.

</Frame>

### 4. Advanced Configuration

While the basic setup is simple, you can still access advanced Portkey features by configuring them in your Config or through the Portkey dashboard:

- **Caching**: Enable semantic or simple caching to reduce costs
- **Fallbacks**: Set up automatic fallbacks between providers
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across multiple API keys
- **Retries**: Configure automatic retry logic
- **Rate Limiting**: Set rate limits for your API usage

These features are configured at the Virtual Key level in your Portkey dashboard, keeping your DSPy code clean and simple.



## Advanced Example: RAG with DSPy and Portkey

Here's a complete example showing how to build a RAG system with DSPy and Portkey:

```python
import dspy

# Configure Portkey-enabled LM
lm = dspy.LM(
    "openai/@openai-provider-slug/gpt-4o",
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    api_base="https://api.portkey.ai/v1"
)
dspy.configure(lm=lm)

# Define a retrieval function
def search_wikipedia(query: str) -> list[str]:
    results = dspy.ColBERTv2(url="http://20.102.90.50:2017/wiki17_abstracts")(query, k=3)
    return [x["text"] for x in results]

# Create a RAG chain
rag = dspy.ChainOfThought("context, question -> response")

# Ask a question
question = "What's the name of the castle that David Gregory inherited?"
result = rag(context=search_wikipedia(question), question=question)

print(result)
# Output: Prediction(
#     reasoning='David Gregory inherited Kinnairdy Castle in 1664, as mentioned in the context provided.',
#     response='The name of the castle that David Gregory inherited is Kinnairdy Castle.'
# )
```


## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Finding Provider Slugs">
Provider slugs can be found in your Portkey's Model Catalog. .
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Model Name Format">
Always use the exact model name as specified by the provider. For example:
- OpenAI: `gpt-4o`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`
- Anthropic: `claude-3-opus-20240229`, `claude-3-sonnet-20240320`
- AWS Bedrock: `anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0`

You can also directly copy this slug from Portkey's model catalog.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Missing LLM Calls in Traces">
DSPy uses caching for LLM calls by default, which means repeated identical requests won't generate new API calls or new traces. To ensure you capture every LLM call:

1. **Disable Caching**: For full tracing during debugging, turn off DSPy's caching
2. **Use Unique Inputs**: Make sure each run uses different inputs to avoid triggering the cache
3. **Clear the Cache**: If you need to test the same inputs again, clear DSPy's cache between runs
4. **Verify Configuration**: Confirm that your DSPy setup is correctly configured with Portkey

Remember to manage caching wisely in production to strike the right balance between thorough tracing and performance efficiency.
