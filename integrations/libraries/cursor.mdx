description: "Learn how to integrate Portkey's enterprise features with Cursor for enhanced observability, reliability and governance."
---

[Cursor](https://cursor.sh) is a powerful AI-first code editor designed to streamline software development with built-in chat, autocomplete, and AI-powered refactoring tools. By integrating **Portkey** as the Gateway for your OpenAI API key, you can secure, monitor, and optimize all your LLM trafficâ€”while gaining centralized visibility, caching, cost control, and enterprise-grade governance.


However, Portkey enables robust chat functionality, prompt management, observability, and token-level insightsâ€”perfect for teams that want more control over their API usage and compliance while still using Cursorâ€™s interface.

Why Integrate Portkey with Cursor?

- **Unified AI Gateway** - Single interface for 1600+ LLMs with API key management. (not just OpenAI & Anthropic)
- **CentraliCursor AI observability**: Real-time usage tracking for 40+ key metrics and logs for every request
- **Governance** - Real-time spend tracking, set budget limits and RBAC in your Cursor setup
- **Security Guardrails** -a PII detection, content filtering, and compliance controls

<Note>
  If you are an enterprise looking to use Cursor in your organisation, [check out this section](#3-set-up-enterprise-governance-for-Cursor).
</Note>
<Note>
  When you use Portkey with Cursor, you wonâ€™t have access to some Cursor-specific features that rely on their proprietary modelsâ€”such as AI autocomplete, "Apply from Chat", or inline refactoring. These are only available on Cursorâ€™s Pro and Enterprise plans.
</Note>



# 1. Setting up Portkey
Portkey allows you to use 1600+ LLMs with your Cursor setup, with minimal configuration required. Let's set up the core components in Portkey that you'll need for integration.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create an Integration">
Navigate to the [Integrations](https://app.portkey.ai/integrations) section on Portkey's Sidebar. This is where you'll connect your LLM providers.

1. Find your preferred provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
2. Click **Connect** on the provider card
3. In the "Create New Integration" window:
   - Enter a **Name** for reference
   - Enter a **Slug** for the integration
   - Enter your **API Key and other provider specific details** for the provider
4. Click **Next Step**

<Frame>
<img src="/images/product/model-catalog/integrations-page.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>

<Note>
In your next step you'll see workspace provisioning options. You can select the default "Shared Team Workspace" if this is your first time OR chose your current one.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Models">

On the model provisioning page:
- Leave all models selected (or customize)
- Toggle Automatically enable new models if desired

Click **Create Integration** to complete the integration

<Frame>
<img src="/images/product/model-catalog/model-provisioning-page.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>


</Step>



<Step title="Copy the Provider Slug">
Once your Integration is created:

1. Go to [Model Catalog](https://app.portkey.ai/model-catalog) â†’ **Models** tab
2. Find and click on you your model button (if your model is not visible, you need to edit your integration from the last step)
3. Copy the **slug** (e.g., `@openai-dev/gpt-4o`)


<Note>
  We recommend clicking the `Run Test Request` button on this step to verify your integration. If you see the error: `You do not have enough permissions to execute this request`, youâ€™ll need to create a **User API Key** for this step to work properly.

  You can create one [here](https://app.portkey.ai/api-keys). You should be able to see simple chat request output on this step.
</Note>

<Frame>
<img src="/images/product/model-catalog/model-integration-model-box.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>

<Note>
This is your unique identifier - you'll need it for the next step. This slug is basically `@your-provider-slug/your-model-name`
</Note>


</Step>

<Step title="Create Default Config">

Portkey's [config](/product/ai-gateway/configs) is a JSON object used to define routing rules for requests to your gateway. You can create these configs in the Portkey app and reference them in requests via the config ID. For this setup, weâ€™ll create a simple config using your provider (OpenAI) and model (gpt-4o).

1. Go to [Configs](https://app.portkey.ai/configs) in Portkey dashboard
2. Create new config with:
    ```json
    {
        "override_params": {
          "model": "@YOUR_SLUG-FROM-LAST_STEP" // example: @openai-test/gpt-4o-mini
        }
    }
    ```
3. Save and note the Config ID & Name for the next step

<Frame>
<img src="/images/product/model-catalog/default-config-model-catalog.png" width="600"/>
</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Portkey API Key">
Finally, create a Portkey API key:

1. Go to [API Keys](https://app.portkey.ai/api-keys) in Portkey
2. Create new API key
3. Select the config that you create from previous step
4. Generate and save your API key

<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/api-key.png" width="300"/>
</Frame>

<Note>
Save your API key securely - you'll need it for Cursor integration.
</Note>

</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
ðŸŽ‰ Voila, Setup complete! You now have everything needed to integrate Portkey with your application.
</Check>


## 2. Integrated Portkey with Cursor
<Note>
    You will need your Portkey API key created in [Step 1](#Setting-up-portkey) for this integration
</Note>

Portkey is an OpenAI compatible API, which means it can be easily integrated with Cursor without any changes to your setup. Here's how you do it


To access Cursor's settings and configure it for OpenAI integration, here are the key steps:

1. **Open Settings:**
   Click on **"Cursor"** in the menu bar and select **"Settings..."** and choose **Cursor Settings**.

2. In the Cursor Settings window, navigate to the **Models** tab.

3. Scroll down to find the **API Keys** section.

4. **Add Your API Keys:** Enable the the OpenAI API Key Toggle add you your **Portkey API Key**.

5. Toggle on the **Override OpenAI Base URL** and Enter Portkeyâ€™s Base URL: `https://api.portkey.ai/v1`
6. Click on Verify.

That's it! now you have succesfully integrated Cursor with Portkey.

# 3. Set Up Enterprise Governance for Cursor

**Why Enterprise Governance?**
If you are using Cursor inside your orgnaization, you need to consider several governance aspects:
- **Cost Management**: Controlling and tracking AI spending across teams
- **Access Control**: Managing team access and workspaces
- **Usage Analytics**: Understanding how AI is being used across the organization
- **Security & Compliance**: Maintaining enterprise security standards
- **Reliability**: Ensuring consistent service across all users
- **Model Management**: Managing what models are being used in your setup

Portkey adds a comprehensive governance layer to address these enterprise

**Enterprise Implementation Guide**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Step 1: Implement Budget Controls & Rate Limits">
### Step 1: Implement Budget Controls & Rate Limits

Model Catalog enables you to have granular control over LLM access at the team/department level. This helps you:
- Set up [budget limits](/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys/budget-limits)
- Prevent unexpected usage spikes using Rate limits
- Track departmental spending

#### Setting Up Department-Specific Controls:
1. Navigate to [Model Catalog](https://app.portkey.ai/model-catalog) in Portkey dashboard
2. Create new Provider for each engineering team with budget limits and rate limits
3. Configure department-specific limits

</Frame>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 2: Define Model Access Rules">
### Step 2: Define Model Access Rules

As your AI usage scales, controlling which teams can access specific models becomes crucial. You can simply manage AI models in your org by provisioning model at the top integration level.


<Frame>
<img src="/images/product/model-catalog/model-provisioning-page.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>


</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 4: Set Routing Configuration">
    Portkey allows you to control your routing logic very simply with it's Configs feature. Portkey Configs provide this control layer with things like:

- **Data Protection**: Implement guardrails for sensitive code and data
- **Reliability Controls**: Add fallbacks, load-balance, retry and smart conditional routing logic
- **Caching**: Implement Simple and Semantic Caching. and more....

#### Example Configuration:
Here's a basic configuration to load-balance requests to OpenAI and Anthropic:

```json
{
	"strategy": {
		"mode": "load-balance"
	},
	"targets": [
		{
			"override_params": {
				"model": "@YOUR_OPENAI_PROVIDER_SLUG/gpt-model"
			}
		},
		{
			"override_params": {
				"model": "@YOUR_ANTHROPIC_PROVIDER/claude-sonnet-model"
			}
		}
	]
}
```

Create your config on the [Configs page](https://app.portkey.ai/configs) in your Portkey dashboard. You'll need the config ID for connecting to Cursor's setup.


<Note>
Configs can be updated anytime to adjust controls without affecting running applications.
</Note>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 4: Implement Access Controls">
### Step 3: Implement Access Controls

Create User-specific API keys that automatically:
- Track usage per developer/team with the help of metadata
- Apply appropriate configs to route requests
- Collect relevant metadata to filter logs
- Enforce access permissions


Create API keys through:
- [Portkey App](https://app.portkey.ai/)
- [API Key Management API](/api-reference/admin-api/control-plane/api-keys/create-api-key)


Example using Python SDK:
```python
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(api_key="YOUR_ADMIN_API_KEY")

api_key = portkey.api_keys.create(
    name="frontend-engineering",
    type="organisation",
    workspace_id="YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID",
    defaults={
        "config_id": "your-config-id",
