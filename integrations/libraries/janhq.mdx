Jan is an open source alternative to ChatGPT that runs 100% offline on your computer. While Jan delivers robust chat capabilities, Portkey adds essential enterprise controls for production deployments:

- **Unified AI Gateway** - Single interface for 1600+ LLMs with API key management. (not just OpenAI & Anthropic)
- **Centralized AI observability**: Real-time usage tracking for 40+ key metrics and logs for every request
- **Governance** - Real-time spend tracking, set budget limits and RBAC in your Jan setup
- **Security Guardrails** - PII detection, content filtering, and compliance controls

This guide will walk you through integrating Portkey with Jan and setting up essential enterprise features including usage tracking, access controls, and budget management.

# 1. Setting up Portkey
Portkey allows you to use 1600+ LLMs with your Jan setup, with minimal configuration required. Let's set up the core components in Portkey that you'll need for integration.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create Virtual Key">
Virtual Keys are Portkey's secure way to manage your LLM provider API keys. Think of them like disposable credit cards for your LLM API keys, providing essential controls like:
- Budget limits for API usage
- Rate limiting capabilities
- Secure API key storage

To create a virtual key:
Go to [Virtual Keys](https://app.portkey.ai/virtual-keys) in the Portkey App. Save and copy the virtual key ID

<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/openai/virtual-key-2.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>

<Note>
Save your virtual key ID - you'll need it for the next step.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Create Default Config">

Configs in Portkey are JSON objects that define how your requests are routed. They help with implementing features like advanced routing, fallbacks, and retries.

We need to create a default config to route our requests to the virtual key created in Step 1.

To create your config:
1. Go to [Configs](https://app.portkey.ai/configs) in Portkey dashboard
2. Create new config with:
    ```json
    {
        "virtual_key": "YOUR_VIRTUAL_KEY_FROM_STEP1",
       	"override_params": {
          "model": "gpt-4o" // Your preferred model name
        }
    }

    ```
3. Save and note the Config name for the next step

<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/config.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>

<Note>
This basic config connects to your virtual key. You can add more advanced portkey features later.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Portkey API Key">

Now create Portkey API key access point and attach the config you created in Step 2:

1. Go to [API Keys](https://app.portkey.ai/api-keys) in Portkey and Create new API key
2. Select your config from `Step 2`
3. Generate and save your API key

<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/api-key.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>

<Note>
Save your API key securely - you'll need it for Jan integration.
</Note>
</Step>
</Steps>

# 2. Integrate Portkey with JanHQ

Now that you have your Portkey components set up, let's connect them to JanHQ. Since Portkey provides OpenAI API compatibility, integration is straightforward and requires just a few configuration steps in your Jan interface.

<Note>
You need your Portkey API Key from [Step 1](#Getting-started-with-portkey) before going further.
</Note>

1. Launch your Jan application
2. Navigate to `Settings > Model Providers > OpenAI`
3. In the OpenAI settings, configure the following settings:
   - Chat Completions Endpoint: `https://api.portkey.ai/v1/chat/completions`
   - API Key: Your Portkey API key from the setup

You can monitor your requests and usage in the [Portkey Dashboard](https://app.portkey.ai/dashboard).

<Warning>
Make sure your virtual key has sufficient budget and rate limits for your expected usage. Also use the complete model name given by the provider.
</Warning>



# 3. Set Up Enterprise Governance for Jan

**Why Enterprise Governance?**
If you are using Jan inside your orgnaization, you need to consider several governance aspects:
- **Cost Management**: Controlling and tracking AI spending across teams
- **Access Control**: Managing which teams can use specific models
- **Usage Analytics**: Understanding how AI is being used across the organization
- **Security & Compliance**: Maintaining enterprise security standards
- **Reliability**: Ensuring consistent service across all users

Portkey adds a comprehensive governance layer to address these enterprise needs. Let's implement these controls step by step.

**Enterprise Implementation Guide**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Step 1: Implement Budget Controls & Rate Limits">
### Step 1: Implement Budget Controls & Rate Limits

Virtual Keys enable granular control over LLM access at the team/department level. This helps you:
- Set up [budget limits](/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys/budget-limits)
- Prevent unexpected usage spikes using Rate limits
- Track departmental spending

#### Setting Up Department-Specific Controls:
1. Navigate to [Virtual Keys](https://app.portkey.ai/virtual-keys) in Portkey dashboard
2. Create new Virtual Key for each department with budget limits and rate limits
3. Configure department-specific limits

<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/openai/virtual-key-2.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 2: Define Model Access Rules">
### Step 2: Define Model Access Rules

As your AI usage scales, controlling which teams can access specific models becomes crucial. Portkey Configs provide this control layer with features like:

#### Access Control Features:
- **Model Restrictions**: Limit access to specific models
- **Data Protection**: Implement guardrails for sensitive data
- **Reliability Controls**: Add fallbacks and retry logic

#### Example Configuration:
Here's a basic configuration to route requests to OpenAI, specifically using GPT-4o:

```json
{
	"strategy": {
		"mode": "single"
	},
	"targets": [
		{
			"virtual_key": "YOUR_OPENAI_VIRTUAL_KEY",
			"override_params": {
				"model": "gpt-4o"
			}
		}
	]
}
```

Create your config on the [Configs page](https://app.portkey.ai/configs) in your Portkey dashboard. You'll need the config ID for connecting to Jan's setup.


<Note>
Configs can be updated anytime to adjust controls without affecting running applications.
</Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 3: Implement Access Controls">
### Step 3: Implement Access Controls

Create User-specific API keys that automatically:
- Track usage per user/team with the help of virtual keys
- Apply appropriate configs to route requests
- Collect relevant metadata to filter logs
- Enforce access permissions


Create API keys through:
- [Portkey App](https://app.portkey.ai/)
- [API Key Management API](/api-reference/admin-api/control-plane/api-keys/create-api-key)


Example using Python SDK:
```python
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(api_key="YOUR_ADMIN_API_KEY")

api_key = portkey.api_keys.create(
    name="engineering-team",
    type="organisation",
    workspace_id="YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID",
    defaults={
        "config_id": "your-config-id",
        "metadata": {
            "environment": "production",
            "department": "engineering"
        }
    },
    scopes=["logs.view", "configs.read"]
)
```

For detailed key management instructions, see our [API Keys documentation](/api-reference/admin-api/control-plane/api-keys/create-api-key).
