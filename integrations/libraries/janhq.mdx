# 1. Setting up Portkey
Portkey allows you to use 1600+ LLMs with your JanHQ setup, with minimal configuration required. Let's set up the core components in Portkey that you'll need for integration.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create an Integration">
Navigate to the [Integrations](https://app.portkey.ai/integrations) section on Portkey's Sidebar. This is where you'll connect your LLM providers.

1. Find your preferred provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
2. Click **Connect** on the provider card
3. In the "Create New Integration" window:
   - Enter a **Name** for reference
   - Enter a **Slug** for the integration
   - Enter your **API Key and other provider specific details** for the provider
4. Click **Next Step**

<Frame>

</Frame>

<Note>
In your next step you'll see workspace provisioning options. You can select the default "Shared Team Workspace" if this is your first time OR chose your current one.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Models">

On the model provisioning page:
- Leave all models selected (or customize)
- Toggle Automatically enable new models if desired

Click **Create Integration** to complete the integration

<Frame>
<img src="/images/product/model-catalog/model-provisioning-page.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>


</Step>


<Step title="Copy the Provider Slug">
Once your Integration is created:

1. Go to [Model Catalog](https://app.portkey.ai/model-catalog) → **AI Providers** tab
2. Find your integration
3. Copy the **slug** (e.g., `openai-dev`)

<Frame>
<img src="/images/product/model-catalog/model-catalog.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>

<Note>
This slug is your provider's unique identifier - you'll need it for the next step.
</Note>


</Step>

<Step title="Create Default Config">

Portkey's [config](/product/ai-gateway/configs) is a JSON object used to define routing rules for requests to your gateway. You can create these configs in the Portkey app and reference them in requests via the config ID. For this setup, we’ll create a simple config using your provider (OpenAI) and model (gpt-4o).

1. Go to [Configs](https://app.portkey.ai/configs) in Portkey dashboard
2. Create new config with:
    ```json
    {
        "virtual_key": "YOUR_PROVIDER_SLUG", //your provider slug from previous step
        "override_params": {
          "model": "gpt-4o" // Your preferred model name exact string
        }
    }
    ```
3. Save and note the Config ID & Name for the next step

<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/config.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Portkey API Key">
Finally, create a Portkey API key:

1. Go to [API Keys](https://app.portkey.ai/api-keys) in Portkey
2. Create new API key
3. Select the config that you create from previous step
4. Generate and save your API key

<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/api-key.png" width="300"/>
</Frame>

<Note>
Save your API key securely - you'll need it for JanHQ integration.
</Note>

</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
🎉 Voila, Setup complete! You now have everything needed to integrate Portkey with your application.
</Check>




# 2. Integrate Portkey with JanHQ

Now that you have your Portkey components set up, let's connect them to JanHQ. Since Portkey provides OpenAI API compatibility, integration is straightforward and requires just a few configuration steps in your Jan interface.

<Note>
You need your Portkey API Key from [Step 1](#Getting-started-with-portkey) before going further.
</Note>

1. Launch your Jan application
2. Navigate to `Settings > Model Providers > OpenAI`
3. In the OpenAI settings, configure the following settings:
   - Chat Completions Endpoint: `https://api.portkey.ai/v1/chat/completions`
   - API Key: Your Portkey API key from the setup

You can monitor your requests and usage in the [Portkey Dashboard](https://app.portkey.ai/dashboard).

<Warning>
Make sure your virtual key has sufficient budget and rate limits for your expected usage. Also use the complete model name given by the provider.
</Warning>




# 3. Set Up Enterprise Governance for JanHQ

**Why Enterprise Governance?**
If you are using JanHQ inside your orgnaization, you need to consider several governance aspects:
- **Cost Management**: Controlling and tracking AI spending across teams
- **Access Control**: Managing team access and workspaces
- **Usage Analytics**: Understanding how AI is being used across the organization
- **Security & Compliance**: Maintaining enterprise security standards
- **Reliability**: Ensuring consistent service across all users
- **Model Management**: Managing what models are being used in your setup

Portkey adds a comprehensive governance layer to address these enterprise

**Enterprise Implementation Guide**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Step 1: Implement Budget Controls & Rate Limits">
### Step 1: Implement Budget Controls & Rate Limits

Model Catalog enables you to have granular control over LLM access at the team/department level. This helps you:
- Set up [budget limits](/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys/budget-limits)
- Prevent unexpected usage spikes using Rate limits
- Track departmental spending

#### Setting Up Department-Specific Controls:
1. Navigate to [Model Catalog](https://app.portkey.ai/model-catalog) in Portkey dashboard
2. Create new Provider for each engineering team with budget limits and rate limits
3. Configure department-specific limits

<Frame>

</Frame>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 2: Define Model Access Rules">
### Step 2: Define Model Access Rules

As your AI usage scales, controlling which teams can access specific models becomes crucial. You can simply manage AI models in your org by provisioning model at the top integration level.


<Frame>
<img src="/images/product/model-catalog/model-provisioning-page.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>


</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 4: Set Routing Configuration">
    Portkey allows you to control your routing logic very simply with it's Configs feature. Portkey Configs provide this control layer with things like:

- **Data Protection**: Implement guardrails for sensitive code and data
- **Reliability Controls**: Add fallbacks, load-balance, retry and smart conditional routing logic
- **Caching**: Implement Simple and Semantic Caching. and more....

#### Example Configuration:
Here's a basic configuration to load-balance requests to OpenAI and Anthropic:

```json
{
	"strategy": {
		"mode": "load-balance"
	},
	"targets": [
		{
			"provider":"@YOUR_OPENAI_PROVIDER",
			"override_params": {
				"model": "gpt-model"
			}
		},
		{
			"provider":"@YOUR_ANTHROPIC_PROVIDER",
			"override_params": {
				"model": "claude-sonnet-model"
			}
		}
	]
}
```

Create your config on the [Configs page](https://app.portkey.ai/configs) in your Portkey dashboard. You'll need the config ID for connecting to JanHQ's setup.


<Note>
Configs can be updated anytime to adjust controls without affecting running applications.
</Note>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 4: Implement Access Controls">
### Step 3: Implement Access Controls

Create User-specific API keys that automatically:
- Track usage per developer/team with the help of metadata
- Apply appropriate configs to route requests
- Collect relevant metadata to filter logs
- Enforce access permissions


Create API keys through:
- [Portkey App](https://app.portkey.ai/)
- [API Key Management API](/api-reference/admin-api/control-plane/api-keys/create-api-key)


Example using Python SDK:
```python
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(api_key="YOUR_ADMIN_API_KEY")

api_key = portkey.api_keys.create(
    name="frontend-engineering",
    type="organisation",
    workspace_id="YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID",
    defaults={
        "config_id": "your-config-id",
        "metadata": {
            "environment": "development",
            "department": "engineering",
            "team": "frontend"
        }
    },
    scopes=["logs.view", "configs.read"]
)
```
