description: 'Integrate Portkey with Claude Code for enterprise-grade AI coding assistance with observability and governance'
---

Claude Code is Anthropic's agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal, understands your codebase, and helps you code faster through natural language commands.

With Portkey integration, you can enhance Claude Code with enterprise features:

- **Unified AI Gateway** - Route Claude Code through multiple providers (Anthropic, Bedrock, Vertex AI)
- **Centralized AI observability**: Real-time usage tracking for 40+ key metrics and logs for every request
- **Governance** - Real-time spend tracking, set budget limits and RBAC in your Claude Code setup


# 1. Setting up Portkey
Portkey allows you to use 1600+ LLMs with your Claude Code setup, with minimal configuration required. Let's set up the core components in Portkey that you'll need for integration.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create an Integration">
Navigate to the [Integrations](https://app.portkey.ai/integrations) section on Portkey's Sidebar. This is where you'll connect your LLM providers.

1. Find your preferred provider (Anthropic, Bedrock and Vertex AI)
2. Click **Connect** on the provider card
3. In the "Create New Integration" window:
   - Enter a **Name** for reference
   - Enter a **Slug** for the integration
   - Enter your **API Key and other provider specific details** for the provider
4. Click **Next Step**

</Frame>

<Note>
In your next step you'll see workspace provisioning options. You can select the default "Shared Team Workspace" if this is your first time OR chose your current one.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Models">

On the model provisioning page:
- Leave all models selected (or customize)
- Toggle Automatically enable new models if desired

Click **Create Integration** to complete the integration


<Note>
    Make sure you enable the models that work with Claude Code
</Note>
<Frame>
<img src="/images/product/model-catalog/model-provisioning-page.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>


</Step>



<Step title="Copy the Provider Slug">
Once your Integration is created:

1. Go to [Model Catalog](https://app.portkey.ai/model-catalog) â†’ **Models** tab
2. Find and click on you your model button (if your model is not visible, you need to edit your integration from the last step). Make Sure  you use Claude models that are supported by Claude Code: sonnet 4/3.7, opus 4, etc.
3. Copy the **slug** (e.g., `@anthropic-claude-code/claude-4-sonnet-latest`)

<Note>
  We recommend clicking the `Run Test Request` button on this step to verify your integration. If you see the error: `You do not have enough permissions to execute this request`, youâ€™ll need to create a **User API Key** for this step to work properly. Create one [here](https://app.portkey.ai/api-keys).


</Note>

<Frame>
<img src="/images/product/model-catalog/model-integration-model-box.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>

<Note>
This is your unique identifier - you'll need it for the next step. This slug is basically `@your-provider-slug/your-model-name`
</Note>


</Step>

<Step title="Create Default Config">

Portkey's [config](/product/ai-gateway/configs) is a JSON object used to define routing rules for requests to your gateway. You can create these configs in the Portkey app and reference them in requests via the config ID. For this setup, weâ€™ll create a simple config using your provider (Anthropic) and model (claude-sonnet-latest).

1. Go to [Configs](https://app.portkey.ai/configs) in Portkey dashboard
2. Create new config with:
    ```json
    {
        "override_params": {
          "model": "@YOUR_SLUG-FROM-LAST_STEP" // example: @Anthropic-test/claude-sonnet-latest-mini
        }
    }
    ```
3. Save and note the Config ID & Name for the next step

<Frame>
<img src="/images/product/model-catalog/default-config-model-catalog.png" width="600"/>
</Frame>
</Step>


<Step title="Configure Portkey API Key">
Finally, create a Portkey API key:

1. Go to [API Keys](https://app.portkey.ai/api-keys) in Portkey
2. Create new API key
3. Select the config that you create from previous step
4. Generate and save your API key

<Frame>
<img src="/images/integrations/api-key.png" width="300"/>
</Frame>

<Note>
Save your API key securely - you'll need it for Claude Code integration.
</Note>

</Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
ðŸŽ‰ Voila, Setup complete! You now have everything needed to integrate Portkey with your application.
</Check>




## 2. Integrate Portkey with Claude Code

Claude Code uses a `settings.json` file for configuration. You'll need to modify the environment variables to route requests through Portkey.

<Info>
For more details on Claude Code proxy configuration, see [Anthropic's documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/bedrock-vertex-proxies).
</Info>


Edit your Claude Code settings file (`~/.claude/settings.json` for global or `.claude/settings.json` in your project):

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://api.portkey.ai",
    "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "dummy",
    "ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS": "x-portkey-api-key: YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY"
  }
}
```

<Note>
    This same JSON will work for Anthropic, Bedrock and Vertex. You will need your Portkey API key created in [Step 1](#Setting-up-portkey) for this integration
</Note>


# 3. Set Up Enterprise Governance for Claude Code

**Why Enterprise Governance?**
If you are using Claude Code inside your orgnaization, you need to consider several governance aspects:
- **Cost Management**: Controlling and tracking AI spending across teams
- **Access Control**: Managing team access and workspaces
- **Usage Analytics**: Understanding how AI is being used across the organization
- **Security & Compliance**: Maintaining enterprise security standards
- **Reliability**: Ensuring consistent service across all users
- **Model Management**: Managing what models are being used in your setup

Portkey adds a comprehensive governance layer to address these enterprise

**Enterprise Implementation Guide**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Step 1: Implement Budget Controls & Rate Limits">
### Step 1: Implement Budget Controls & Rate Limits

Model Catalog enables you to have granular control over LLM access at the team/department level. This helps you:
- Set up [budget limits](/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys/budget-limits)
- Prevent unexpected usage spikes using Rate limits
- Track departmental spending

#### Setting Up Department-Specific Controls:
1. Navigate to [Model Catalog](https://app.portkey.ai/model-catalog) in Portkey dashboard
2. Create new Provider for each engineering team with budget limits and rate limits
3. Configure department-specific limits

<Frame>
<img src="/images/product/model-catalog/create-provider-page.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 2: Define Model Access Rules">
### Step 2: Define Model Access Rules

As your AI usage scales, controlling which teams can access specific models becomes crucial. You can simply manage AI models in your org by provisioning model at the top integration level.


<Frame>
<img src="/images/product/model-catalog/model-provisioning-page.png" width="500"/>
</Frame>


</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 4: Set Routing Configuration">
    Portkey allows you to control your routing logic very simply with it's Configs feature. Portkey Configs provide this control layer with things like:

- **Data Protection**: Implement guardrails for sensitive code and data
- **Reliability Controls**: Add fallbacks, load-balance, retry and smart conditional routing logic
- **Caching**: Implement Simple and Semantic Caching. and more....

#### Example Configuration:
Here's a basic configuration to load-balance requests to Anthropic and Anthropic:

```json
{
	"strategy": {
		"mode": "load-balance"
	},
	"targets": [
		{
			"override_params": {
				"model": "@YOUR_Anthropic_PROVIDER_SLUG/gpt-model"
			}
		},
		{
			"override_params": {
				"model": "@YOUR_ANTHROPIC_PROVIDER/claude-sonnet-model"
			}
		}
	]
}
```

Create your config on the [Configs page](https://app.portkey.ai/configs) in your Portkey dashboard. You'll need the config ID for connecting to Claude Code's setup.


<Note>
Configs can be updated anytime to adjust controls without affecting running applications.
</Note>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 4: Implement Access Controls">
### Step 3: Implement Access Controls

Create User-specific API keys that automatically:
- Track usage per developer/team with the help of metadata
- Apply appropriate configs to route requests
- Collect relevant metadata to filter logs
- Enforce access permissions


Create API keys through:
- [Portkey App](https://app.portkey.ai/)
- [API Key Management API](/api-reference/admin-api/control-plane/api-keys/create-api-key)


Example using Python SDK:
```python
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(api_key="YOUR_ADMIN_API_KEY")

api_key = portkey.api_keys.create(
    name="frontend-engineering",
    type="organisation",
    workspace_id="YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID",
    defaults={
        "config_id": "your-config-id",
        "metadata": {
            "environment": "development",
            "department": "engineering",
            "team": "frontend"
        }
    },
    scopes=["logs.view", "configs.read"]
)
```

For detailed key management instructions, see our [API Keys documentation](/api-reference/admin-api/control-plane/api-keys/create-api-key).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step 5: Deploy & Monitor">
### Step 4: Deploy & Monitor
After distributing API keys to your engineering teams, your enterprise-ready Claude Code setup is ready to go. Each developer can now use their designated API keys with appropriate access levels and budget controls.
Apply your governance setup using the integration steps from earlier sections
Monitor usage in Portkey dashboard:
- Cost tracking by engineering team
- Model usage patterns for AI agent tasks
- Request volumes
- Error rates and debugging logs
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Max Plan and Anthropic Oauth (Enterprise Only)

If you are using max plan or logging in with anthropic, you can still use Portkey to track usage and cost, apply ratelimiting and more.

Here is an example of how to configure your `~/.claude/settings.json` to use Portkey with max plan or anthropic oauth:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://api.portkey.ai",
    "ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS": "x-portkey-api-key: YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
  }
}
```
