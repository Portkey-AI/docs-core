description: "The GitLab MCP server enables AI agents to interact with GitLabâ€”the DevOps platform for software development, security, and operations."  
---
Through MCP, assistants can programmatically access repositories, issues, merge requests, pipelines, and more without embedding long-lived tokens inside agents. This server is designed for conversational and automated engineering workflows within the GitLab ecosystem.

## **When should you use this server**

* Retrieve and create issues or merge requests without switching contexts
* Access pipeline status and job information for CI/CD workflows
* Query project metadata and repository details
* Automate GitLab operations with natural language commands and AI assistance

## **Key features**

* Project information and metadata retrieval
* Issue and merge request querying and creation
* Pipeline and CI/CD job inspection
* Repository browsing and file access
* Secure OAuth authentication with permission controls

## **Authentication**

Method  
OAuth 2.1 or personal access tokens (depending on instance setup)

Scopes  
Based on the required operations - read_api, api, read_repository

Notes  
Premium and Ultimate tier requirement; respects user permissions and roles

## **Endpoints**

* **GitLab.com (cloud):** Uses GitLab's cloud-hosted MCP server
* **Self-managed:** Supports on-premise GitLab instances with appropriate configuration

Premium and Ultimate tier only; additional configuration may be required for self-managed instances.

## **FAQ**

### What authentication method should I use?
OAuth 2.1 is recommended for most users as it provides better security and granular permissions. Personal access tokens are available for self-managed instances or specific use cases.

### What if I encounter "Insufficient permissions" errors?
Verify your GitLab role has the appropriate permissions for the requested action. Some operations require specific roles (Maintainer, Owner) or explicit permissions.

### Can I use this with my self-managed GitLab instance?
Yes, self-managed GitLab instances running Premium or Ultimate tier can configure the MCP server. Refer to the GitLab documentation for specific setup requirements.

### How do I troubleshoot connection issues?
* Confirm you're using a compatible MCP client
* Verify authentication credentials and scopes
* Check GitLab instance version and tier
* Review network access between your client and the GitLab instance
* Check GitLab logs for more detailed error information
