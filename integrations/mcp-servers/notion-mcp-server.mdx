title: "Notion MCP server"
description: "The Notion MCP server enables AI agents to interact with Notion, a versatile workspace that combines note-taking, project management, knowledge bases, and relational databases. Through MCP, assistants can programmatically retrieve, search, and update pages, blocks, and databases—turning Notion into a live context source or task sink for AI workflows."
---

## **When should you use this server**

* Pull meeting notes or project trackers directly from Notion databases.
* Update tasks or write back summaries into shared workspaces.
* Search across blocks, pages, or databases to surface relevant knowledge.
* Automate repetitive workspace actions (create pages, append notes).

## **Key features**

* **Page & block interaction** — Retrieve, create, update, and delete pages and blocks (text, headings, todos, images).
* **Database operations** — Query databases with filters and sorts, fetch entries, and add new rows.
* **Content search** — Search for keywords or properties across an entire workspace.
* **User information** — Look up metadata about workspace members.
* **Workspace organization** — Understand nested page structure and database relationships.

## **Authentication**

* **Method:** OAuth2 via Notion integration.
* **Setup:** You install the Notion MCP integration into your workspace, select which pages/databases to share, and complete the OAuth flow.
* **Notes:** Minimum scopes are `read:content`, `update:content`, and `databases`; wider scopes may be needed for advanced actions.

## **Endpoints**

**Remote hosted MCP server (recommended):**
`https://mcp.notion.com/sse`
* Provides OAuth sign-in, token-efficient streaming, and optimized AI usage.

**Local MCP server (advanced):**  
Can be run with npm or Docker for offline or custom deployments:
`npx @notion/mcp-server`  
or
`docker run notion/mcp-server`

## **Setup & usage**

1. Create a Notion integration and note the client ID/secret.
2. Decide whether to connect via the **hosted remote server** (simplest, one-click OAuth) or run a **local server**.
3. Add the MCP server config to your client (Claude Desktop, VS Code, Portkey Gateway).
4. Complete OAuth flow (remote) or provide integration token (local).
