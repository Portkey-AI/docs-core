title: "Linear MCP server"  
description: "The Linear MCP server provides a standardized interface for AI models and agents to securely access and manage data from your Linear workspace."  
---

Linear's MCP server is **centrally hosted and managed**, following the authenticated remote MCP specification. It supports creating, updating, and retrieving objects across Linear in a way that respects your existing permissions.

## **When should you use it?**

Use the Linear MCP server when you want to:

* Search and retrieve issues, projects, cycles, and documents from Linear.

* Create and update issues, projects, or comments via natural language commands.

* Integrate Linear data directly into AI-powered workflows (e.g., task planning, meeting follow-ups).

* Provide secure, real-time access to Linear data without custom integrations.

## **Endpoints**

* **Transport options**:

  * HTTP: `https://mcp.linear.app/mcp`

  * SSE: `https://mcp.linear.app/sse`

* **Authentication**: OAuth 2.1 with dynamic client registration.

* **Recommendation**: Use the **streamable HTTP endpoint** where supported for improved reliability.

* **Compatibility**: Works natively with Claude, Cursor, and other MCP clients. For older clients, the `mcp-remote` module ensures backwards compatibility.
