title: "Postman MCP server"
description: "The Postman MCP Server connects Postman to AI tools, enabling assistants and agents to securely access and interact with Postman workspaces, collections, environments, and APIs through natural language. It bridges Postman's API platform with AI-driven automation, allowing developers to query, evaluate, and modify Postman resources directly from their MCP-compatible clients."  
---

Two configurations are supported:
* **Minimal** — Default setup with essential tools for basic workspace, collection, and environment management.
* **Full** — Includes 100+ Postman API tools for enterprise-level collaboration, automation, and analytics.

Postman MCP is available as a remote server or via npm for local setup.

## When you should use this server

* Automate **collection and workspace management** through AI agents.
* **Sync code** and collections seamlessly between your IDE and Postman.
* **Generate API specs** from code or auto-document APIs using conversational commands.
* Query, update, and comment on requests, collections, and environments from AI editors like Claude, Cursor, or Codex.
* Manage variables, environments, and monitor API performance across projects.

Ideal for developers integrating Postman context into their AI workflows.

## Requirements

* **API Key**: A valid Postman API key is required.
* **EU Region Support**:
   * Streamable HTTP: `https://mcp.eu.postman.com`
   * STDIO package: use `--region` flag (`us` or `eu`) or set the `POSTMAN_API_BASE_URL` environment variable.
* **Package option**: Available as an npm module for local deployments.

### Minimal Configuration

Essential tools for basic Postman operations (faster and lighter).
* Manage and modify **collections**, **workspaces**, and **environments**.
* Fetch and update API documentation or environment variables.

### Full Configuration

Includes all 100+ Postman API endpoints, supporting:
* **Advanced collaboration** — comments, sharing, and team workspaces.
* **API lifecycle management** — from specification to testing and monitoring.
* **Bulk automation** — create, tag, or update multiple requests and collections.
* **Reporting and analysis** — generate API metrics, usage reports, and test summaries.

## Notes

* The Postman MCP server integrates directly with MCP-compatible editors like Claude, Cursor, and Goose.
* Full configuration offers deep access for enterprise users leveraging Postman's collaboration and governance features.
* Ideal for teams wanting conversational control over API management, documentation, and testing.
* Performance varies slightly between minimal and full configurations — minimal is best for fast, lightweight use; full for multi-project automation.
