## When should you use it

Use the Atlassian Remote MCP server when you want to:

* Summarize and search Jira, Confluence, and Compass content without switching between apps.
* Create and update issues, pages, or components from natural language instructions.
* Automate bulk workflows (e.g., generating Jira tickets from meeting notes, importing Compass components).
* Integrate tasks across Atlassian products, like linking Jira issues with Confluence documentation.

## Requirements

* **Availability**: Cloud-based; no local setup required.
* **Authentication**: OAuth 2.1 (respects Atlassian permissions and access controls).
* **Plans & limits** (Beta):
  * Standard plan → moderate usage thresholds.
  * Premium / Enterprise plans → higher quotas (up to **1,000 requests/hour** + per-user limits).
* **Eligibility**: Open to all Atlassian Cloud customers (no special signup needed).

## Tools

### Jira workflows

* **Search issues** → "Find all open bugs in Project Alpha."
* **Create/update issue** → "Create a story titled 'Redesign onboarding'."
* **Bulk create issues** → "Make five Jira issues from these notes."

### Confluence workflows

* **Summarize page** → "Summarize the Q2 planning page."
* **Create page** → "Create a page titled 'Team Goals Q3'."
* **Navigate spaces** → "What spaces do I have access to?"

### Compass workflows

* **Create component** → "Create a service component based on the current repository."
* **Bulk import components** → "Import components and custom fields from this CSV/JSON."
* **Query dependencies** → "What depends on the api-gateway service?"

### Combined tasks

* **Link content** → "Link these three Jira tickets to the 'Release Plan' page."
* **Find documentation** → "Fetch the Confluence documentation page linked to this Compass component."

## Notes

* Actual capabilities depend on **user permissions** and **MCP client platform**.
* **Known limitations (Beta):**
  * Bulk operations may be restricted by rate limits or input format support.
  * Custom Jira fields may require manual setup.
  * Some clients (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Cursor) may need additional configuration or are partially supported.
  * Workspace/site switching is not supported in a single session.
