title: "Qdrant MCP server"  
description: "The Qdrant MCP server enables AI agents to store and retrieve semantic information using vector search through MCP. Built for persistent memory, contextual knowledge, and efficient semantic retrieval workflows."  
---

## When you should use this server

- Give AI assistants **persistent memory** across sessions and conversations
- Store knowledge, facts, or documents in a vector database for later retrieval
- Retrieve **semantic matches** to queries instead of relying on exact keyword lookups
- Manage contextual memory for long-running workflows or applications

## Key features

- Semantic vector storage and retrieval
- Context-aware memory persistence
- Efficient similarity search
- Metadata filtering and payload storage
- Cross-session memory for AI assistants
- Compatibility with both cloud and self-hosted deployments


## Requirements

- **Hosting:** Works with a running Qdrant instance (cloud or self-hosted)
- **Authentication:** Standard Qdrant API authentication (if enabled)
- **Collections:** Requires specifying a collection name unless a default is configured

## Tools provided

### qdrant-store

Stores information in the Qdrant vector database with optional metadata.

**Parameters:**
- `information` *(string, required)* — content to store
- `metadata` *(JSON, optional)* — associated metadata to store alongside the vector
- `collection_name` *(string, required if no default)* — collection to store data in

**Returns:**
- Confirmation message with vector ID and status

### qdrant-find

Retrieves semantically relevant information from Qdrant based on the meaning of the query.

**Parameters:**
- `query` *(string, required)* — text to search for semantically similar content
- `collection_name` *(string, required if no default)* — collection to search

**Returns:**
- Matching stored information, ordered by semantic similarity

## Notes

- Best used as a **memory backend** for AI assistants needing semantic recall
- Requires an active Qdrant instance; supports both **Qdrant Cloud** and **self-hosted deployments**
