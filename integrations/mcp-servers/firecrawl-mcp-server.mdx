title: "Firecrawl MCP server"  
description: "The Firecrawl MCP server enables AI agents to perform web scraping, crawling, search, extraction, and research through MCP. Built for content discovery and information retrieval workflows."  
---

## When you should use this server

- Scrape and extract content from web pages or entire domains.
- Perform batch scraping jobs with built-in rate limiting.
- Search the web and optionally extract structured content from results.
- Conduct deep research using a combination of crawling, search, and LLM-powered summarization.
- Generate standardized **llms.txt** and **llms-full.txt** files to guide LLM interactions with your site.
- Integrate **content discovery, crawling, and extraction** into AI-driven workflows.

## Key features

- Web scraping with custom wait times and content filters
- Batch scraping with parallel execution
- Deep web crawling with configurable depth and limits
- Structured data extraction from web pages
- LLM-powered research and summarization
- Generation of standardized LLM guidance files

## Tools provided

### firecrawl_scrape

Scrape content from a single URL with options for format, wait time, and content filtering.

### firecrawl_batch_scrape

Scrape multiple URLs in parallel; returns a batch operation ID for status tracking.

### firecrawl_check_batch_status

Check the progress or results of a batch scrape operation.

### firecrawl_search

Run a web search; optionally scrape and extract structured content from search results.

### firecrawl_crawl

Launch an asynchronous crawl with configurable depth, limits, and external link rules.

### firecrawl_extract

Extract structured information from pages using an LLM and a defined schema (supports both cloud and self-hosted LLMs).

### firecrawl_deep_research

Perform deep research on a query using crawling, search, and LLM analysis with constraints (depth, time, max URLs).

### firecrawl_generate_llmstxt

Generate standardized **llms.txt** and **llms-full.txt** files to define how LLMs should interact with a site.

## Notes

- Supports both **cloud-hosted** and **self-hosted** deployments.
- Includes **robust logging** for operation status, rate limits, and credit usage.
- Automatic retries and backoff are built-in for error handling.
- Returned data respects configured API quotas and credit limits.
