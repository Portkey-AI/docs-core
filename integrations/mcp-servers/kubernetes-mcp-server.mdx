title: "Kubernetes MCP server"  
description: "The Kubernetes MCP server provides a flexible Model Context Protocol (MCP) interface for managing and interacting with Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters."  
---
## When should you use it

Use the Kubernetes MCP server when you want to:

- Manage Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters through **AI assistants**.
- Perform **CRUD operations** on Kubernetes resources (pods, deployments, services, etc.).
- Work with **Helm charts** (install, list, uninstall).
- Query logs, metrics, and events from the cluster.
- Automate operational workflows like **resource scaling, monitoring, and troubleshooting**.
- Extend support to OpenShift with **projects** and additional resource types.

## Requirements

- **Supported platforms**: Kubernetes and OpenShift.
- **Configuration**:
  - Uses `~/.kube/config` or in-cluster config.
  - Automatically detects changes and reloads.
- **Dependencies**: Kubernetes cluster access with sufficient RBAC permissions.

## Tools

### Configuration

**configuration_view** — View the current Kubernetes configuration (full or minified).

### Events

**events_list** — List Kubernetes events across namespaces (or filtered by namespace).

### Helm

**helm_install** — Install a Helm chart.

**helm_list** — List Helm releases (all or specific namespaces).

**helm_uninstall** — Uninstall a Helm release.

### Namespaces & Projects

**namespaces_list** — List all namespaces in the cluster.

**projects_list** — List all OpenShift projects.

### Pods

**pods_list** — List all pods in the cluster.

**pods_list_in_namespace** — List pods in a specific namespace.

**pods_get** — Get details of a specific pod.

**pods_log** — Retrieve logs from a pod (with container and previous options).

**pods_exec** — Execute commands inside a pod container.

**pods_delete** — Delete a pod by name.

**pods_run** — Run a new pod with a specified image.

**pods_top** — Retrieve pod CPU/memory usage (via metrics server).

### Resources (Generic CRUD)

**resources_create_or_update** — Create or update a Kubernetes resource from YAML/JSON.

**resources_get** — Retrieve a specific resource.

**resources_list** — List resources (by API version, kind, namespace, label selectors).

**resources_delete** — Delete a resource by kind and name.

### Dashboards & Monitoring

**pods_top** — Get resource usage for pods (cluster-wide or namespace-specific).

## Notes

- Works with both **self-managed Kubernetes clusters** and **OpenShift**.
- Supports **Helm operations** natively for release management.
- RBAC permissions must match the requested operations (e.g., creating pods, deleting resources).
- Ideal for use cases where AI agents need to act as **cluster copilots** for devops, troubleshooting, and automation.
