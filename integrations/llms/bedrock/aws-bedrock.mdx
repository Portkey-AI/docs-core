Portkey provides a robust and secure gateway to facilitate the integration of various Large Language Models (LLMs) into your applications, including models hosted on AWS Bedrock.

With Portkey, you can take advantage of features like fast AI gateway access, observability, prompt management, and more, all while ensuring the secure management of your LLM API keys through a [virtual key](/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys) system.

<Note>
Provider Slug. `bedrock`

## Portkey SDK Integration with AWS Bedrock

Portkey provides a consistent API to interact with models from various providers. To integrate Bedrock with Portkey:

### 1\. Install the Portkey SDK

Add the Portkey SDK to your application to interact with Anthropic's API through Portkey's gateway.


<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS">

```sh
npm install --save portkey-ai
```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python">
        ```sh
        pip install portkey-ai
        ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>




### 2\. Initialize Portkey with the Virtual Key

There are two ways to integrate AWS Bedrock with Portkey:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="AWS Access Key" href="/integrations/llms/aws-bedrock#how-to-find-your-aws-credentials">
<br />Use your `AWS Secret Access Key`, `AWS Access Key Id`, and `AWS Region` to create your Virtual key.<br /><br />

[**Integration Guide**](/integrations/llms/aws-bedrock#how-to-find-your-aws-credentials)
</Card>
<Card title="AWS Assumed Role" href="/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys/bedrock-amazon-assumed-role">
<br />Take your `AWS Assumed Role ARN` and `AWS Region` to create the virtaul key.<br /><br /><br />

[**Integration Guide**](/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys/bedrock-amazon-assumed-role)
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">
        ```js
        import Portkey from 'portkey-ai'

        const portkey = new Portkey({
            apiKey: "PORTKEY_API_KEY", // defaults to process.env["PORTKEY_API_KEY"]
            virtualKey: "VIRTUAL_KEY" // Your Bedrock Virtual Key
        })
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python SDK">
        ```python
        from portkey_ai import Portkey

        portkey = Portkey(
            api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",  # Replace with your Portkey API key
            virtual_key="VIRTUAL_KEY"   # Replace with your virtual key for Bedrock
        )
        ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

#### Using Virtual Key with AWS STS

If you're using [AWS Security Token Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/welcome.html), you can pass your `aws_session_token` along with the Virtual key:


<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS">
        ```js
        import Portkey from 'portkey-ai'

        const portkey = new Portkey({
            apiKey: "PORTKEY_API_KEY", // defaults to process.env["PORTKEY_API_KEY"]
            virtualKey: "VIRTUAL_KEY" // Your Bedrock Virtual Key,
            aws_session_token: ""
        })
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python">
        ```python
        from portkey_ai import Portkey

        portkey = Portkey(
            api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",  # Replace with your Portkey API key
            virtual_key="VIRTUAL_KEY"   # Replace with your virtual key for Bedrock,
            aws_session_token=""
        )
        ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>


#### Not using Virtual Keys?

[Check out this example on how you can directly use your AWS details to make a Bedrock request through Portkey.](/integrations/llms/bedrock/aws-bedrock#making-requests-without-virtual-keys)

### **3\. Invoke Chat Completions with AWS bedrock**

Use the Portkey instance to send requests to Anthropic. You can also override the virtual key directly in the API call if needed.


<Tabs>
    <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">
        ```js
        const chatCompletion = await portkey.chat.completions.create({
            messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],
            model: 'anthropic.claude-v2:1',
            max_tokens: 250 // Required field for Anthropic
        });

        console.log(chatCompletion.choices);
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python SDK">
        ```python
        completion = portkey.chat.completions.create(
            messages= [{ "role": 'user', "content": 'Say this is a test' }],
            model= 'anthropic.claude-v2:1',
            max_tokens=250 # Required field for Anthropic
        )

        print(completion.choices)
        ```
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>




## Using Vision Models

Portkey's multimodal Gateway fully supports Bedrock's vision models `anthropic.claude-3-sonnet`, `anthropic.claude-3-haiku`, and `anthropic.claude-3-opus`

For more info, check out this guide:

[Vision](/product/ai-gateway/multimodal-capabilities/vision)

## Extended Thinking (Reasoning Models) (Beta)

<Note>
The assistants thinking response is returned in the `response_chunk.choices[0].delta.content_blocks` array, not the `response.choices[0].message.content` string.
</Note>

Models like `us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0` support [extended thinking](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/anthropics-claude-3-7-sonnet-the-first-hybrid-reasoning-model-is-now-available-in-amazon-bedrock/).
This is similar to openai thinking, but you get the model's reasoning as it processes the request as well.

Note that you will have to set [`strict_open_ai_compliance=False`](/product/ai-gateway/strict-open-ai-compliance) in the headers to use this feature.

## Bedrock Converse API

Portkey uses the [AWS Converse API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_Converse.html) internally for making chat completions requests.

If you need to pass [additional input fields or parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_Converse.html#API_runtime_Converse_RequestSyntax) like `anthropic_beta`, `top_k`, `frequency_penalty` etc. that are specific to a model, you can pass it with this key:
```json
"additionalModelRequestFields": {
    "frequency_penalty": 0.4
}
```

If you require the model to [respond with certain fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_Converse.html#API_runtime_Converse_RequestSyntax) that are specific to a model, you need to pass this key:
```json
"additionalModelResponseFieldPaths": [ "/stop_sequence" ]
```

## Managing AWS Bedrock Prompts

You can manage all prompts to AWS bedrock in the [Prompt Library](/product/prompt-library). All the current models of Anthropic are supported and you can easily start testing different prompts.

Once you're ready with your prompt, you can use the `portkey.prompts.completions.create` interface to use the prompt in your application.

## Making Requests without Virtual Keys

If you do not want to add your AWS details to Portkey vault, you can also directly pass them while instantiating the Portkey client.

### Mapping the Bedrock Details

| awsRegion          | aws\_region              | x-portkey-aws-region            |

## How to Find Your AWS Credentials

[Navigate here in the AWS Management Console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/security%5Fcredentials) to obtain your **AWS Access Key ID** and **AWS** **Secret Access Key.**

* In the console, you'll find the '**Access keys'** section. Click on '**Create access key**'.
* Copy the `Secret Access Key` once it is generated, and you can view the `Access Key ID` along with it.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/llms/access-key.png" alt="acess" />
    </Frame>

* On the same [page](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/security%5Fcredentials) under the '**Access keys'** section, where you created your Secret Access key, you will also find your **Access Key ID.**
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/llms/retrieve.png" alt="retrieve" />
    </Frame>

* And lastly, get Your `AWS Region` from the Home Page of[ AWS Bedrock](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-east-1#/overview) as shown in the image below.

You'll find more information in the relevant sections:

1. [Add metadata to your requests](/product/observability/metadata)
2. [Add gateway configs to your Bedrock requests](/product/ai-gateway/configs)
3. [Tracing Bedrock requests](/product/observability/traces)
4. [Setup a fallback from OpenAI to Beckrock APIs](/product/ai-gateway/fallbacks)
