## Portkey SDK Integration with Pinecone

Portkey provides a consistent API to interact with Pinecone's reranking models. To integrate Pinecone with Portkey:

### 1. Install the Portkey SDK

Add the Portkey SDK to your application to interact with Pinecone's models through Portkey's gateway.

  <Tab title="NodeJS">
    ```sh
    npm install --save portkey-ai
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```sh

    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Initialize Portkey with the Virtual Key

To use Pinecone with Portkey, [get your API key from here](https://app.pinecone.io/), then add it to Portkey to create the virtual key.

### 3. Reranking with Pinecone

Portkey supports Pinecone's reranking models through a unified `/v1/rerank` endpoint.

```sh
curl https://api.portkey.ai/v1/rerank \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-portkey-api-key: $PORTKEY_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "@pinecone-dev/bge-reranker-v2-m3",
