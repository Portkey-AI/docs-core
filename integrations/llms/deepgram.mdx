Deepgram provides industry-leading speech-to-text capabilities. Portkey allows you to use Deepgram's API with full observability and reliability features.

<Note>
Deepgram currently uses a custom host setup. SDK support is available through the custom host pattern.

## Quick Start

Get started with Deepgram in under 2 minutes:

### Speech to Text - Local File

Transcribe audio from a local file:

```bash cURL
curl https://api.portkey.ai/v1/listen \
  -H "Authorization: Token $DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: audio/mp3" \
  -H "x-portkey-custom-host: https://api.deepgram.com/v1" \
  -H "x-portkey-provider: openai" \
  -H "x-portkey-api-key: $PORTKEY_API_KEY" \
  --data-binary '@audio.mp3'
```

### Speech to Text - Remote File

Transcribe audio from a URL:

```bash cURL
curl https://api.portkey.ai/v1/listen \
  -H "Authorization: Token $DEEPGRAM_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-portkey-custom-host: https://api.deepgram.com/v1" \
  -H "x-portkey-provider: openai" \
  -H "x-portkey-api-key: $PORTKEY_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"url": "https://dpgr.am/spacewalk.wav"}'
```

## Using with Portkey SDK

You can also use Deepgram with the Portkey SDK using custom host configuration:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(
    api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    provider="openai",
    custom_host="https://api.deepgram.com/v1",
    Authorization="Token DEEPGRAM_API_KEY"
)

# Use with audio transcription
# Note: Specific implementation depends on your use case
```

```javascript Node.js
import Portkey from 'portkey-ai';

const portkey = new Portkey({
    apiKey: 'PORTKEY_API_KEY',
    provider: 'openai',
    customHost: 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1',
    Authorization: 'Token DEEPGRAM_API_KEY'
});

// Use with audio transcription
// Note: Specific implementation depends on your use case
```

</CodeGroup>
