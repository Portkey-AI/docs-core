## Portkey SDK Integration with Voyage

Portkey provides a consistent API to interact with models from Voyage. To integrate Voyage with Portkey:

### 1. Install the Portkey SDK

Add the Portkey SDK to your application to interact with Voyage AI's models through Portkey's gateway.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="NodeJS">
    ```sh
    npm install --save portkey-ai
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```sh
    pip install portkey-ai
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Initialize Portkey with the API Key

To use Voyage with Portkey, [get your API key from here](https://dash.voyageai.com/), then add it to Portkey to create the virtual key.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="NodeJS SDK">
    ```javascript
    import Portkey from 'portkey-ai'

    const portkey = new Portkey({
        apiKey: "PORTKEY_API_KEY", // defaults to process.env["PORTKEY_API_KEY"]
        Authorization: "VOYAGE_API_KEY",  // Replace with your Voyage API key
        provider: "voyage"
    })
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python SDK">
    ```python
    from portkey_ai import Portkey

    portkey = Portkey(
        api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",  # Replace with your Portkey API key
        Authorization="VOYAGE_API_KEY",  # Replace with your Voyage API key
        provider="voyage"
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Embeddings

Embedding endpoints are natively supported within Portkey like this:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="NodeJS">
    ```javascript
    const embedding = await portkey.embeddings.create({
        input: 'Name the tallest buildings in Hawaii',
        model: 'voyage-3'
    });

    console.log(embedding);
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python SDK">
    ```python
    embedding =  portkey.embeddings.create(
        input= 'Name the tallest buildings in Hawaii',
        model= 'voyage-3'
    )

    print(embedding)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Re-ranking

Portkey supports Voyage AI's reranking models through a unified `/v1/rerank` endpoint.

```sh
curl https://api.portkey.ai/v1/rerank \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-portkey-api-key: $PORTKEY_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "@voyage-ai-prod/rerank-2",
    "query": "What is the capital of the United States?",
    "documents": [
      "Carson City is the capital city of the American state of Nevada.",
      "The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean. Its capital is Saipan.",
      "Washington, D.C. (also known as simply Washington or D.C., and officially as the District of Columbia) is the capital of the United States. It is a federal district.",
      "Capital punishment (the death penalty) has existed in the United States since beforethe United States was a country. As of 2017, capital punishment is legal in 30 of the 50 states."
    ],
    "top_n": 3,
    "return_documents": true
  }'
```
