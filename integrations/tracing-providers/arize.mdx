<Note>
Portkey provides comprehensive observability out-of-the-box. This integration is for teams who want to consolidate their ML observability in Arize Phoenix alongside Portkey's AI Gateway capabilities.
</Note>

## Why Portkey + Arize Phoenix?

[Arize Phoenix](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference/tree/main/python/instrumentation/openinference-instrumentation-portkey) brings observability to LLM workflows with tracing, prompt debugging, and performance monitoring.

Thanks to Phoenix's OpenInference instrumentation, Portkey can emit structured traces automatically — no extra setup needed. This gives you clear visibility into every LLM call, making it easier to debug and improve your app.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the required packages to enable Arize Phoenix integration with your Portkey deployment:

<CodeGroup>

```bash arize
pip install portkey-ai openinference-instrumentation-portkey arize-otel
```

```bash phoenix
pip install portkey-ai openinference-instrumentation-portkey arize-phoenix-otel
```
</CodeGroup>

### Setting up the Integration

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure Arize Phoenix">
First, set up the Arize OpenTelemetry configuration:

<CodeGroup>
```python arize
from arize.otel import register

# Configure Arize as your telemetry backend
tracer_provider = register(
    space_id="your-space-id",      # Found in Arize app settings
    api_key="your-api-key",        # Your Arize API key
    project_name="portkey-gateway" # Name your project
)
```

```python phoenix
from phoenix.otel import register

# Configure Arize as your telemetry backend
tracer_provider = register(
    space_id="your-space-id",      # Found in Arize app settings
    api_key="your-api-key",        # Your Arize API key
    project_name="portkey-gateway" # Name your project
)
```


</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Enable Portkey Instrumentation">
Initialize the Portkey instrumentor to format traces for Arize:

```python
from openinference.instrumentation.portkey import PortkeyInstrumentor

# Enable instrumentation
PortkeyInstrumentor().instrument(tracer_provider=tracer_provider)
```
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Portkey AI Gateway">
Set up Portkey with all its powerful features:

```python
from portkey_ai import Portkey

# Initialize Portkey client
portkey = Portkey(
    api_key="your-portkey-api-key",  # Optional for self-hosted
    virtual_key="your-openai-virtual-key"  # Or use provider-specific virtual keys
)

response = portkey.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain machine learning"}]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Complete Integration Example

Here's a complete working example that connects Portkey's AI Gateway with Arize Phoenix for centralized monitoring:


```python [expandable]
import os
from openai import OpenAI
from portkey_ai import PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL, createHeaders
from arize.otel import register  # OR from phoenix.otel import register

# configure the Phoenix tracer
from openinference.instrumentation.portkey import PortkeyInstrumentor

# Step 1: Configure Arize Phoenix
tracer_provider = register(
    space_id="your-space-id",
    api_key="your-arize-api-key",
    project_name="portkey-production"
)

# Step 2: Enable Portkey instrumentation
PortkeyInstrumentor().instrument(tracer_provider=tracer_provider)

# Step 3: Configure Portkey's Advanced AI Gateway

}

# Initialize Portkey-powered client
client = OpenAI(
    api_key="not-needed",  # Virtual keys handle auth
    base_url=PORTKEY_GATEWAY_URL,
    default_headers=createHeaders(
        api_key=os.environ.get("PORTKEY_API_KEY"),
