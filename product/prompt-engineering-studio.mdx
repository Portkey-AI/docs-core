Effective prompt management is crucial for getting the most out of Large Language Models (LLMs). Portkey provides a comprehensive solution for creating, managing, versioning, and deploying prompts across your AI applications.

Portkey's Prompt Engineering Studio offers a robust ecosystem of tools to streamline your prompt engineering workflow:

- **Create and compare prompts** in the interactive Multimodal Playground
- **Version** your prompts for production use
- **Deploy** optimized prompts via simple API endpoints
- **Monitor performance** with built-in observability
- **Collaborate** with your team through shared prompt library

Whether you're experimenting with different prompts or managing them at scale in production, Prompt Engineering Studio provides the tools you need to build production ready AI applications.

## Setting Up AI Providers

Before you can create and manage prompts, you'll need to set up your [Virtual Keys](/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys). After configuring your keys, the respective AI providers become available for running and managing prompts.

Portkey supports over 1600+ models across all the major providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and many others. This allows you to build and test prompts across multiple models and providers from a single interface.

## [Prompt Playground & Templates](/product/prompt-engineering-studio/prompt-playground)

The [Prompt Playground](/product/prompt-engineering-studio/prompt-playground) is a complete Prompt Engineering IDE for crafting and testing prompts. It provides a rich set of features:

- **Run on any LLM**: Test your prompts across different models and providers to find the best fit for your use case
- **Multimodal support**: Input and analyze images alongside text in your prompts
- **Side-by-side comparisons**: Compare responses across 1600+ models or prompts in parallel
- **Tool integration**: Add and test custom [tools](/product/prompt-engineering-studio/tool-library) for more powerful interactions
- **Prompt templates**: Create dynamic prompts that can change based on the variables passed in
- **AI-assisted improvements**: Leverage AI to refine your prompts

The playground provides immediate feedback, allowing you to rapidly iterate on your prompt designs before deploying them to production. Once you're satisfied with a prompt, you can save it to the [prompt library](/product/prompt-engineering-studio/prompt-library) and use it in your code simply.

## [Prompt Versioning](/product/prompt-engineering-studio/prompt-versioning)
Prompt versioning allows you to maintain a history of your prompt changes and promote stable versions to production.
Any update on the saved prompt will create a new version. You can switch back to an older version anytime.

Versioning ensures you can safely experiment while maintaining stable prompts in production.

## [Prompt Library](/product/prompt-engineering-studio/prompt-library)
The Prompt Library is your central repository for managing all prompts across your organization. Within the library, you can organize prompts in folders, set access controls, and collaborate with team members. The library makes it easy to maintain a consistent prompt strategy across your applications and teams.

## [Prompt Partials](/product/prompt-engineering-studio/prompt-partial)
Prompt Partials allow you to create reusable components that can be shared across multiple prompts. These are especially useful for standard instructions or context that appears in multiple prompts. Partials help reduce duplication and maintain consistency in your prompt library.

## [Prompt Observability](/product/prompt-engineering-studio/prompt-observability)
Prompt Observability provides insights into how your prompts are performing in production through usage logs, performance metrics, and version comparison. These insights help you continuously improve your prompts based on real-world usage.

## [Prompt API](/product/prompt-engineering-studio/prompt-api)
The Prompt API allows you to integrate your saved prompts directly into your applications through Completions and Render endpoints. The API makes it simple to use your optimized prompts in production applications, with CRUD operations coming soon.
