Portkey Gateway supports fine-tuning in two ways:

1. Fine-tuning with portkey as a provider, supports multiple providers with a single unified API.
2. Fine-tuning with Portkey as a client, supports following providers:
   - [OpenAI](/integrations/llms/openai/fine-tuning)
   - [Bedrock](/integrations/llms/bedrock/fine-tuning)
   - [Azure OpenAI](/integrations/llms/azure-openai/fine-tuning)

## 1. Fine-tuning with Portkey as a client

With Portkey acting as a client, gives you the following benefits:

1. Provider specific fine-tuning.
2. More control over the fine-tuning process.
3. Unified API for all providers.

## 2. Fine-tuning with Portkey as a provider

With Portkey acting as provider, gives you the following benefits:

1. Unified API for all providers
2. No need to manage multiple endpoints and keys
3. Easy to switch between providers with limited changes
4. Easier integration with Portkey's other features like batching, etc.

## How to use fine-tuning

Portkey supports a Unified Fine-tuning API for all providers which is based on OpenAI's Fine-tuning API.

While the signature of API is same for all providers, there are places where a specific provider require some more information which can be passed via headers if used as a client, or by `portkey_options` params if used as a provider.

### Fine-tuning with Portkey as a client

**Upload a File**

```sh
curl -X POST --header 'x-portkey-api-key: <portkey_api_key>' \
 --form 'file=@dataset.jsonl' \
 --form 'purpose=fine-tune' \
 'https://api.portkey.ai/v1/files'
```

**Create a Fine-tuning Job**

```sh
curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --header 'x-portkey-api-key: <portkey_api_key>' \
 --data \
 $'{"model": "<base_model>", "suffix": "<finetune_name>", "training_file": "<file_id>", "portkey_options": {"x-portkey-virtual-key": "<virtual_key>"}, "method": {"type": "supervised", "supervised": {"hyperparameters": {"n_epochs": 1}}}}\n' \
'https://api.portkey.ai/v1/fine_tuning/jobs'
```

<Tip>
  `portkey_options` supports all the options that are supported by each provider
  in the gateway. Values can be provider specific, refer to provider's
  documentation for each provider's specific options required for fine-tuning.
</Tip>

**List Fine-tuning Jobs**

```sh
curl -X GET --header 'x-portkey-api-key: <portkey_api_key>' \
'https://api.portkey.ai/v1/fine_tuning/jobs'
```

**Get Fine-tuning Job**

```sh
curl -X GET --header 'x-portkey-api-key: <portkey_api_key>' \
'https://api.portkey.ai/v1/fine_tuning/jobs/<job_id>'
```

**Cancel Fine-tuning Job**

```sh
curl -X POST --header 'x-portkey-api-key: <portkey_api_key>' \
'https://api.portkey.ai/v1/fine_tuning/jobs/<job_id>/cancel'
```

When you use Portkey as a provider for fine-tuning, everything is managed by Portkey hosted solution, this includes job submission with provider, monitoring job status and able to use the fine-tuned model with Portkey's Prompt Playground.

<Note>
  Providers like OpenAI, Azure OpenAPI does provider a straight forward approach
  to use the fine-tuned model for inference whereas providers like `Bedrock` abd
  `Vertex` does require you to manually provider compute which is hard for
  portkey to manage.
</Note>

**Notes**:

- For `Bedrock`, `model` param should point to the `modelId` from `portkey` and the `modelId` to submit to the provider should be passed via `provider_options`. Example is available below.

```sh
  curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-portkey-api-key: <portkey_api_key>' \
  --data \
  $'{"model": "amazon.titan-text-lite-v1:0", "suffix": "<finetune_name>", "training_file": "<file_id>", "provider_options": {"model": "amazon.titan-text-lite-v1:0:4k"}, "method": {"type": "supervised", "supervised": {"hyperparameters": {"n_epochs": 1}}}}\n' \
  'https://api.portkey.ai/v1/fine_tuning/jobs'
```

> For more info about `modelId`, please refer to the provider's documentation.

Please refer to the provider's documentation for fine-tuning with Portkey as a gateway.
