title: "Thinking Mode"
---

Thinking/Reasoning models represent a new generation of LLMs specifically trained to expose their internal reasoning process. Unlike traditional LLMs that only show final outputs, thinking models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet, OpenAI o1/o3, and Deepseek R1 are designed to "think out loud" - producing a detailed chain of thought before delivering their final response.

These reasoning-optimized models are built to excel in tasks requiring complex analysis, multi-step problem solving, and structured logical thinking. Portkey makes these advanced models accessible through a unified API specification that works consistently across providers.

## Supported Thinking Models

Portkey currently supports thinking-enabled models from **Anthropic**, **Google Vertex AI**, **Amazon Bedrock**, **OpenAI**, and other **OpenAI-compatible providers**.

*Note: If a specific model is not supported for thinking on Portkey, please reach out to us on Discord.*


## Using Thinking Mode

1. You must set `strict_open_ai_compliance=False` in your headers or client configuration
2. The thinking response is returned in a different format than standard completions
3. For streaming responses, the thinking content is in `response_chunk.choices[0].delta.content_blocks`

<Warning>
Extended thinking API through Portkey is currently in beta.

## Understanding Response Format

When using thinking-enabled models, be aware of the special response format:

<Note>
The assistant's thinking response is returned in the `response_chunk.choices[0].delta.content_blocks` array, not the `response.choices[0].message.content` string.
</Note>

This is especially important for streaming responses, where you'll need to specifically parse and extract the thinking content from the content blocks.

## When to Use Thinking Models

Thinking models are particularly valuable in specific use cases:



## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use thinking mode with any model?">
    No, thinking mode is only available on specific reasoning-optimized models. Currently, this includes Claude 3.7 Sonnet and will expand to other models as they become available.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does thinking mode increase token usage?">
    Yes, enabling thinking mode will increase your token usage since the model is generating additional content for its reasoning process. The `budget_tokens` parameter lets you control the maximum tokens allocated to thinking.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to handle the response differently for thinking mode?">
    Yes, particularly for streaming responses. The thinking content is returned in the `content_blocks` array rather than the standard content field, so you'll need to adapt your response parsing logic.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why do I need to set strict_open_ai_compliance to false?">
    The thinking mode response format extends beyond the standard OpenAI completion schema. Setting `strict_open_ai_compliance` to false allows Portkey to return this extended format with the thinking content.
