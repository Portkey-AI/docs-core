<Tip>
To apply budgets and rate limits at the workspace level (across keys), see [Enforce Workspace Budget and Rate Limits](/product/administration/enforce-workspace-budget-limts-and-rate-limits).
</Tip>

**Budget Limits on Providers** provide a simple way to manage your spending on AI providers (and LLMs) - giving you confidence and control over your application's costs.

Budget Limit is currently only available to **Portkey** [**Enterprise Plan**](https://portkey.ai/docs/product/enterprise-offering) customers. Email us at `support@portkey.ai` if you would like to enable it for your org.

## Setting Budget Limits on Providers

When creating a new integration on Portkey, you can set limits in two ways:

### Cost-Based Limits
Set a budget limit in USD that, once reached, will automatically expire the key to prevent further usage and overspending.

### Token-Based Limits
Set a maximum number of tokens that can be consumed, allowing you to control usage independent of cost fluctuations.

And you can set both these limtis for each workspace.

> #### Key Considerations
>
> * Budget limits can be set as either cost-based (USD) or token-based
> * The minimum cost limit you can set is **$1**
> * The minimum token limit you can set is **100 tokens**
> * Budget limits apply until exhausted or reset
> * Budget limits are applied only to requests made after the limit is set; they do not apply retroactively
> * Once set, budget limits **cannot be edited** by any organization member
> * Budget limit feature is available for **all LLMs** available on Portkey and will apply to **all members/workspaces** who have permission to use it.

## Alert Thresholds

You can now set alert thresholds to receive notifications before your budget limit is reached:

* For cost-based budgets, set thresholds in USD
* For token-based budgets, set thresholds in tokens
* Receive email notifications when usage reaches the threshold
* Continue using the key until the full budget limit is reached

## Periodic Reset Options

You can configure budget limits to automatically reset at regular intervals:

### Reset Period Options
- **No Periodic Reset**: The budget limit applies until exhausted with no automatic renewal
- **Reset Weekly**: Budget limits automatically reset every week
- **Reset Monthly**: Budget limits automatically reset every month

### Reset Timing
- Weekly resets occur at the beginning of each week (Sunday at 12 AM UTC)
- Monthly resets occur on the **1st** calendar day of the month, at **12 AM UTC**, irrespective of when the budget limit was set prior

## Editing Budget Limits

If you need to change or update a budget limit, you can **duplicate** the existing provider and create a new one with the desired limit.

## Monitoring Your Spending and Usage

You can track your spending and token usage for any specific provider by navigating to the Analytics tab and filtering by the **desired provider** and **timeframe**.

## Pricing Support and Limitations

Budget limits currently apply to all providers and models for which Portkey has pricing support. If a specific request log shows `0 cents` in the COST column, it means that Portkey does not currently track pricing for that model, and it will not count towards the providers's budget limit.

For token-based budgets, Portkey tracks both input and output tokens across all supported models.

It's important to note that budget limits cannot be applied retrospectively. The spend counter starts from zero only after you've set a budget limit for a key.

## Availability

Budget Limits is currently available **exclusively to Portkey Enterprise** customers and select Pro users. If you're interested in enabling this feature for your account, please reach out to us at [support@portkey.ai](mailto:support@portkey.ai) or join the [Portkey Discord](https://portkey.ai/community) community.
