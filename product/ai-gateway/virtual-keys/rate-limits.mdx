Rate Limits lets you set request or token consumption limits on virtual keys

<Info>
Available on **Enterprise** plan and select **Pro** customers.
</Info>

**Rate Limits on Virtual Keys** provide a powerful way to control the frequency of API requests or token consumption for your AI providers - giving you confidence and control over your application's usage patterns and performance.

Rate Limit is currently only available to **Portkey** [**Enterprise Plan**](https://portkey.ai/docs/product/enterprise-offering) customers and select Pro users. Email us at `support@portkey.ai` if you would like to enable it for your org.

## Setting Rate Limits on Virtual Keys

When creating a new virtual key on Portkey, you can set rate limits in two ways:

### Request-Based Limits
Set a maximum number of requests that can be made within a specified time period (per minute, hour, or day).

### Token-Based Limits
Set a maximum number of tokens that can be consumed within a specified time period (per minute, hour, or day).

> #### Key Considerations
>
> * Rate limits can be set as either request-based or token-based
> * Time intervals can be configured as per minute, per hour, or per day
> * Setting the limit to 0 disables the virtual key
> * Rate limits apply immediately after being set
> * Once set, budget limits **cannot be edited** by any organization member
> * Rate limits work for **all providers** available on Portkey and apply to **all organization members** who use the virtual key
> * After a rate limit is reached, requests will be rejected until the time period resets

## Rate Limit Intervals

You can choose from three different time intervals for your rate limits:

* **Per Minute**: Limits reset every minute, ideal for fine-grained control
* **Per Hour**: Limits reset hourly, providing balanced usage control
* **Per Day**: Limits reset daily, suitable for broader usage patterns

## Exceeding Rate Limits

When a rate limit is reached:
* Subsequent requests are rejected with a specific error code
* Error messages clearly indicate that the rate limit has been exceeded
* The limit automatically resets after the specified time period has elapsed

## Editing Rate Limits

If you need to change or update a rate limit, you can **duplicate** the existing virtual key and create a new one with the desired limit.

## Monitoring Your Usage

You can track your request and token usage for any specific virtual key by navigating to the Analytics tab and filtering by the **desired key** and **timeframe**.

## Use Cases for Rate Limits

* **Cost Control**: Prevent unexpected usage spikes that could lead to high costs
* **Performance Management**: Ensure your application maintains consistent performance
* **Fairness**: Distribute API access fairly across teams or users
* **Security**: Mitigate potential abuse or DoS attacks
* **Provider Compliance**: Stay within the rate limits imposed by underlying AI providers

Rate Limits is currently available **exclusively to Portkey Enterprise** customers and select Pro users.
