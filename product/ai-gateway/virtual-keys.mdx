<Warning>
**Virtual Keys have been migrated to Model Catalog**

The Virtual Keys feature has been upgraded to the **Model Catalog** system, which provides better governance, centralized management, and model-level controls. The core concept remains the same - one Portkey API key gives you access to multiple providers and models.

</Warning>

## What Changed?

The Virtual Keys feature has evolved into the **Model Catalog** system. Here's what you need to know:

### Core Concept (Still the Same)
- ✅ **One Portkey API key** → Access **multiple providers** → Use **hundreds of models**
- ✅ Provider credentials stored securely, never exposed in code
- ✅ Centralized management and governance

### What's New in Model Catalog
- **Organization-level management**: Share credentials across workspaces
- **Better governance**: Fine-grained budgets, rate limits, and model allow-lists
- **Simpler usage**: Just use `model="@provider-slug/model-name"` format
- **Enhanced security**: Improved credential management and access controls

## Quick Start with Model Catalog

1. **Add a Provider**: Go to [Model Catalog](https://app.portkey.ai/model-catalog) → Add Provider
2. **Use in Code**: Use the `@provider-slug/model-name` format in your requests
3. **Manage Access**: Set budgets, rate limits, and model access controls

```python
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY")

# Use Model Catalog providers
response = portkey.chat.completions.create(
    model="@openai-prod/gpt-4o",  # Provider slug + model name
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
```
