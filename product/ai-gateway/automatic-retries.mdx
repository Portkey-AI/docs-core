title: "Automatic Retries"
description: "LLM APIs often have inexplicable failures. With Portkey, you can rescue a substantial number of your requests with our in-built automatic retries feature. "
---

<Info>
  This feature is available on all Portkey [plans](https://portkey.ai/pricing).
</Info>

* Automatic retries are triggered **up to 5 times**
* Retries can also be triggered only on **specific error codes**
* Each subsequent retry attempt follows **exponential backoff strategy** to prevent network overload
* Optionally respects provider's `Retry-After` headers for rate-limited requests

## Enabling Retries

To enable retry, just add the `retry` param to your [config object](/api-reference/config-object).

### Retry with 5 attempts

```JSON
{
    "retry": {
        "attempts": 5
    },
    "virtual_key": "virtual-key-xxx"
}
```

### Retry only on specific error codes

By default, Portkey triggers retries on the following error codes: **\[429, 500, 502, 503, 504\]**

You can change this behaviour by setting the optional `on_status_codes` param in your retry config and manually inputting the error codes on which retry will be triggered.


```JSON
{
  "retry": {
    "attempts": 3,
    "on_status_codes": [ 408, 429, 401 ]
  },
  "virtual_key": "virtual-key-xxx"
}
```

<Info>
  If the `on_status_codes` param is present, retries will be triggered **only** on the error codes specified in that Config and not on Portkey's default error codes for retries (i.e. \[429, 500, 502, 503, 504\])
</Info>

### Respecting provider's retry headers

Portkey can respect the provider's `retry-after-ms`, `x-ms-retry-after-ms` and `retry-after`response headers when encountering rate limits. This enables more intelligent retry timing based on the provider's response headers rather than using the default exponential backoff strategy.

To enable this feature, add the `use_retry_after_headers` parameter to your retry config. By default this behaviour is disabled, and `use_retry_after_headers` is set to `false`.

```JSON
{
  "retry": {
    "attempts": 3,
    "on_status_codes": [ 429 ],
    "use_retry_after_headers": true
  },
  "virtual_key": "virtual-key-xxx"
}
```

<Info>
When `use_retry_after_headers` is set to `true` and the provider includes `Retry-After` or `Retry-After-ms` headers in their response, Portkey will use these values to determine the wait time before the next retry attempt, overriding the exponential backoff strategy.

If the provider doesn't include these headers in the response, Portkey will fall back to the standard exponential backoff strategy.

The cumulative retry wait time for a single request is capped at 60 seconds. For example, if the first retry has a wait time of 20 seconds, and the second retry response includes a Retry-After value of 50 seconds, the request will fail since the total wait time (20+50=70) exceeds the 60-second cap. Similarly, if any single Retry-After value exceeds 60 seconds, the request will fail immediately.

### Exponential backoff strategy

When not using provider retry headers (or when they're not available), Portkey triggers retries following this exponential backoff strategy:

| Attempt           | Time out between requests |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| Initial Call      | Immediately               |
| Retry 1st attempt | 1 second                  |
| Retry 2nd attempt | 2 seconds                 |
| Retry 3rd attempt | 4 seconds                 |
| Retry 4th attempt | 8 seconds                 |
| Retry 5th attempt | 16 seconds                |

### Retry only on specific error codes

By default, Portkey triggers retries on the following error codes: **\[429, 500, 502, 503, 504\]**

You can change this behaviour by setting the optional `on_status_codes` param in your retry config and manually inputting the error codes on which rety will be triggered.


```JSON

  "retry": {
    "attempts": 3,
    "on_status_codes": [ 408, 429, 401 ]

### Exponential backoff strategy

Here's how Portkey triggers retries following exponential backoff:

| Attempt           | Time out between requests |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| Initial Call      | Immediately               |
| Retry 1st attempt | 1 second                  |
| Retry 2nd attempt | 2 seconds                 |
| Retry 3rd attempt | 4 seconds                 |
| Retry 4th attempt | 8 seconds                 |
| Retry 5th attempt | 16 seconds                |

### Understanding the Retry Attempt Header

In the response from Portkey, you can find the `x-portkey-retry-attempt-count` header which provides information about retry attempts:

- If the value is `-1`: This means that Portkey exhausted all the retry attempts and the request was unsuccessful
- If the value is `0`: This means that there were no retries configured
- If the value is `>0`: This means that Portkey attempted retries and this is the exact number at which the request was successful

<Note>
Currently, Portkey does not log all the retry attempts individually in the logs dashboard. Instead, the response times from all retry attempts are summed up in the single log entry.
