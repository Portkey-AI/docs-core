Portkey supports managing files in two ways:

1. Uploading and managing files to any provider using the unified signature
2. [Enterprise Only] Uploading files to Portkey and using them for batching/fine-tuning requests with any provider

## 1. Uploading and managing files to any provider using the unified signature

Please refer to the [Provider Specific Files](/integrations/llms/openai/files) documentation for more details.

1. [OpenAI](/integrations/llms/openai/files)
2. [Bedrock](/integrations/llms/bedrock/files)
3. [Azure OpenAI](/integrations/llms/azure-openai/files)

## 2. [Enterprise Only] Uploading files to Portkey and using them for batching/fine-tuning requests with any provider

With Portkey, you can upload files to Portkey and reuse them for [batching inference](/product/ai-gateway/batches) with any provider and [fine-tuning](/product/ai-gateway/fine-tuning) with supported providers.

In this way, you can test your data with different foundation models, perform A/B testing with different foundation models, and perform batch inference with different foundation models.

### Uploading Files
