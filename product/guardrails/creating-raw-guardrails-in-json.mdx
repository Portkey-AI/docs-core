title: "Creating Raw Guardrails (in JSON)"
description: With the raw Guardrails mode, we let you define your Guardrail checks & actions however you want, directly in code.
---

At Portkey, we believe in helping you make your workflows [as modular as possible](https://portkey.ai/blog/what-it-means-to-go-to-prod/).
This is useful when:
* You want the same Guardrail checks but want to take different basic actions on them
* Your Guardrail checks definitions are dependent on an upstream task and are updated in code
* You want greater control over how you want to handle Guardrails

With the Raw Guardrails mode, you can achieve all this.

### Example of a Raw Guardrail

```JSON
"before_request_hooks": [{
    "type": "guardrail",
    "id": "my_solid_guardrail",
    "checks": [{
      "id": "default.regexMatch",
      "parameters": {
        "regex": "test"
      }
    }]
}]
```

In this example:

* `type`: Specifies the type of hook, which is `guardrail`.
* `name`: Gives a name to the guardrail for identification.
* `checks`: Lists the checks that make up the guardrail. Each check includes an `id` and `parameters` for the specific conditions to validate.

### Configuring Guardrail Actions

```JSON
"before_request_hooks": [{
    "type": "guardrail",
    "id": "my_solid_guardrail",
    "checks": [{
      "id": "default.regexMatch",
      "parameters": {
        "regex": "test"
      }
    }],
    "deny": false,
    "async": false,
    "on_success": {
        "feedback": {"value": 1,"weight": 1}
    },
    "on_fail": {
        "feedback": {"value": -1,"weight": 1}
     }
}]
```
In this example,

* `deny`: Is set to `TRUE` or `FALSE`
* `async`: Is set to `TRUE` or `FALSE`
* `on_success`: Used to pass custom `feedback`
* `on_failure`: Used to pass custom `feedback`
