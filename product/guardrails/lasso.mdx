## Using Lasso with Portkey

### 1. Add Lasso Credentials to Portkey

* Navigate to the `Integrations` page under `Settings`
* Click on the edit button for the Lasso integration
* Add your Lasso API Key (obtain this from your Lasso Security account)

### 2. Add Lasso's Guardrail Check

* Navigate to the `Guardrails` page and click the `Create` button
* Search for "Scan Content" and click `Add`
* Set the timeout in milliseconds (default: 10000ms)
* Set any `actions` you want on your check, and create the Guardrail!

<Note>
    Guardrail Actions allow you to orchestrate your guardrails logic. You can learn more about them [here](/product/guardrails#there-are-6-types-of-guardrail-actions)
</Note>

| Check Name | Description | Parameters | Supported Hooks |
|------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| Scan Content | Lasso Security's Deputies analyze content for various security risks including jailbreak attempts, custom policy violations, sexual content, hate speech, illegal content, and more. | `Timeout` (number) | `beforeRequestHook` |



### 3. Add Guardrail ID to a Config and Make Your Request

* When you save a Guardrail, you'll get an associated Guardrail ID - add this ID to the `input_guardrails` or `output_guardrails` params in your Portkey Config
* Create these Configs in Portkey UI, save them, and get an associated Config ID to attach to your requests. [More here](/product/ai-gateway/configs).

Here's an example config:

```json
{
  "input_guardrails": ["guardrails-id-xxx", "guardrails-id-yyy"],
  "output_guardrails": ["guardrails-id-xxx", "guardrails-id-yyy"]
}
```

## Key Security Features

Lasso Security's Deputies analyze content for various security risks across multiple categories:

1. **Prompt Injections**: Detects attempts to manipulate AI behavior through crafted inputs
2. **Data Leaks**: Prevents sensitive information from being exposed through AI interactions
3. **Jailbreak Attempts**: Identifies attempts to bypass AI safety mechanisms
4. **Custom Policy Violations**: Enforces your organization's specific security policies
5. **Harmful Content Detection**: Flags sexual content, hate speech, illegal content, and more

Lasso's security service helps enterprises maintain control over their AI interactions while protecting sensitive information and preventing misuse of AI systems.
