## What is Metadata?

Metadata in Portkey allows you to attach custom contextual information to your AI requests. Think of it as tagging your requests with important business context that helps you:

- **Track usage** across different users, environments, or features
- **Filter logs** to isolate specific request types
- **Analyze patterns** in how your AI is being used
- **Audit activities** for compliance and security

```python
# Example metadata
{
    "_user": "user-123",      # Who made this request?
    "environment": "prod",    # Where was it made from?
    "feature": "chat-assist", # What feature was using AI?
    "request_id": "42aff12"   # Your internal tracking ID
}
```

## Metadata Keys and Values

- You can send **any number** of metadata keys with each request
- All values must be **strings** with a maximum length of **128** characters
- Keys can be any string, but some have special meaning (like `_user`)

### Special Metadata Keys

| Key | Purpose | Notes |
|-----|---------|-------|
| `_user` | User tracking | Powers user-level analytics in the Portkey dashboard |

<Info>
**About the `_user` key:** If you pass a `user` field in your OpenAI request body, we'll automatically copy it to the `_user` metadata key. If both exist, the explicit `_user` metadata value takes precedence.
</Info>

## Where to See Your Metadata

### Analytics Dashboard

Analytics dashboard has a dedicated Tab to view aggregate stats on all your metadat keys:
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/metadata.png" alt="Analytics with metadata filters" />
</Frame>



### Request Logs

You can also apply any metadata filters to the logs or analytics and filter data by any metadata key you've used:
<Frame>
<img src="/images/metadata-filters.png" />
</Frame>


## Enterprise Features

For enterprise users, Portkey offers advanced metadata governance and lets you define metadata at multiple levels:

1. **Request level** - Applied to a single request
2. **API key level** - Applied to all requests using that key
3. **Workspace level** - Applied to all requests in a workspace

<Card title="Enforcing Required Metadata" href="/product/administration/enforcing-request-metadata">
  Define mandatory metadata fields that must be included with all requests
</Card>

When the same key appears at multiple levels, the **precedence order** is:

1. Workspace metadata (highest priority)
2. API key metadata
3. Request metadata (lowest priority)

<Info>
  Please note that before 1.10.20, the precedence order was:
  1. Request metadata (highest priority)
  2. API key metadata
  3. Workspace metadata (lowest priority)
</Info>

## Best Practices

- Use **consistent keys** across your organization
- Create **naming conventions** for metadata keys
- Consider adding these common fields:
  - `_user`: Who initiated this request
  - `environment`: Which environment (dev/staging/prod)
  - `feature` or `component`: Which part of your product
  - `version`: API or app version
  - `session_id`: To group related requests
  - `request_id`: Your internal tracking ID

- For proper tracking, **always include the `_user` field** when the request is on behalf of an end-user
