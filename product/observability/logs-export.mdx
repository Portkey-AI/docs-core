## Export File Details

Exported logs are provided in JSONL format (JSON Lines), where each line is a valid JSON object representing a single log entry. This format is ideal for data processing and analysis with tools like Python's Pandas or other data analysis frameworks.

Each export includes:
- Up to 50,000 logs per export job (as shown in the preview panel)
- All fields selected during the export configuration
- A timestamp indicating when the export was created

## Use Cases for Exported Logs

With your exported logs data, you can:
- Generate custom reports for stakeholders
- Feed data into business intelligence tools
- Identify patterns in user behavior and model performance

You can analyze your API usage patterns, monitor performance, optimize costs, and make data-driven decisions for your business or team.
