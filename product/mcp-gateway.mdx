description: The universal adapter for Model Context Protocol—connect once, access every MCP tool .
---

MCP Gateway connects your AI applications to any Model Context Protocol server with a single unified interface. Instead of juggling multiple MCP implementations, authentication methods, and connection protocols, you get one consistent API that works with every remote MCP tool—from GitHub to production databases. Set up once, connect everywhere.

## What is MCP Gateway?
MCP Gateway is a universal adapter for the Model Context Protocol ecosystem. It acts as a bridge between your AI applications and remote MCP servers, handling authentication, protocol translation, and connection management so you don't have to. Think of it as a smart proxy that speaks every MCP dialect fluently.

<Note>
**Remote MCP servers only**: Portkey's MCP Gateway exclusively supports remote MCP servers over HTTP/SSE transport protocols. Local STDIO-based MCP servers are not supported.

If you have a STDIO-based MCP server, see our guide on [Converting STDIO MCP Servers to Streamable HTTP](/guides/converting-stdio-to-streamable-http).

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Multiple Integrations**: Every server has separate credentials and methods                | **One Integration**: Single OAuth 2.1 authentication for all servers                 |
| **Authentication Chaos**: Different auth methods for each server (OAuth, API keys, PATs)    | **Unified Authentication**: Single oauth token to rule them all                      |
| **Protocol Fragmentation**: SSE here, StreamableHTTP there, different transports everywhere | **Protocol Agnostic**: We handle HTTP and SSE transports. You just make requests     |
| **No Central Control**: Monitoring, rate limiting, and access control spread across systems | **Central Command**: Monitor, control, and secure all MCP connections from one place |
| **Team Friction**: "Works on my machine" becomes "works with my MCP setup"                  | **Team Harmony**: Share MCP configurations across your entire organization           |
## Key Features

**🔌 Universal Compatibility**
Connect to any remote MCP server over HTTP or SSE transport—whether it's the official github server, a community database connector, or your custom internal tool. If it speaks MCP over HTTP/SSE, we speak to it.

**🔐 Enterprise-Ready Security**
Built-in authentication, encryption in transit, secret management, and fine-grained access control. Your MCP tools are powerful—keep them secure.

**⚡ Performance at Scale**
Intelligent session management, connection pooling, automatic retries, and caching. Handle thousands of concurrent MCP operations without breaking a sweat.

**📊 Complete Observability**
See every request, track latency, monitor errors, and understand usage patterns. Built-in dashboards and OpenTelemetry support for your existing stack.

**🤝 Team Collaboration**
Share MCP server configurations, manage access permissions, and ensure everyone on your team has the tools they need—configured correctly, every time.

## So what will you build with MCP?

**🤖 AI Assistants That Actually Assist**
Give Claude, ChatGPT, or your custom AI chatbot real access to your tools. Edit files, query databases, call APIs—all through MCP Gateway's secure connection.

*"Create a GitHub issue for the login bug and assign it to the backend team"*

🧑🏻‍💻 **Development workflows that fly**
Connect your IDE (Cursor, Claude Code, VS Code, etc) to MCP servers for additional context to one-shot that feature request.

*"Build me an MCP Gateway like Portkey"*

**🤖 AI Agents with Superpowers**
Build custom AI agents using any framework (OpenAI Agents, CrewAI, Langgraph, etc.) with tool calling powered by MCP servers from the Gateway. Your agents get access to every authorized server through user-level OAuth.

*"Just shipped an agent to find a new lunch place and message the team on Slack"*

**🏢 Enterprise AI Infrastructure**
Centralize your AI tool access. Audit who's using what. Rate limit expensive operations. Ensure compliance. Sleep better at night.

*"Hey, can you give me access to that protected resource. I swear I won't rm -rf"*
