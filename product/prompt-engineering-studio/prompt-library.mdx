Portkey's Prompt Library serves as your central repository for managing, organizing, and collaborating on prompts across your organization. This feature enables teams to maintain consistent prompt strategies while making prompt templates easily accessible to all team members.

The Prompt Library offers a structured way to store and manage your prompt templates. It provides:
- A central location for all your prompt templates
- Folder organization for logical grouping
- Collaboration capabilities for team environments

This centralized approach helps maintain consistency in your AI interactions while making it easy to reuse proven prompt patterns across different applications.

## Accessing the Prompt Library

You can access the Prompt Library from the left navigation menu by clicking on "Prompts" under the Prompt Engineering section. This opens the main library view where you can see all your prompt templates and folders.

## Library Organization

Prompts can be organized into folders for better categorization. For example, you might create separate folders for:
- Customer service prompts
- Content generation prompts
- Data analysis prompts
- Agent-specific prompts

## Creating New Prompts

To add a new prompt to your library:
1. Click the "Create" button in the top-right corner
2. Select "Prompt" from the dropdown menu
3. Build your prompt in the [Prompt Playground](/product/prompt-engineering-studio/prompt-playground)
4. Save the prompt to add it to your library

New prompts are automatically assigned a unique ID that you can use to reference them in your applications via the [Prompt API](/product/prompt-engineering-studio/prompt-api).

### Organizing with Folders

To create a new folder:
1. Click "Create" in the top-right corner
2. Select "Folder" from the dropdown
3. Name your folder based on its purpose or content type

To move prompts into folders:
1. Select the prompts you want to organize
2. Use the move option to place them in the appropriate folder

## Collaboration Features

The Prompt Library is designed for team collaboration:
- All team members with appropriate permissions can access shared prompts
- Changes are tracked by user and timestamp through [Prompt Versioning](/product/prompt-engineering-studio/prompt-versioning)
- Multiple team members can work on different prompts simultaneously

This collaborative approach ensures that your team maintains consistent prompt strategies while allowing everyone to contribute their expertise.
