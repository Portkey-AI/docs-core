## [Portkey AI Gateway](https://github.com/portkey-ai/rubeus)

We have open sourced our battle-tested AI Gateway to the community - it connects to 250+ LLMs with a unified interface and a single endpoint, and lets you effortlessly setup fallbacks, load balancing, retries, and more.

This gateway is in production at Portkey processing billions of tokens every day.
