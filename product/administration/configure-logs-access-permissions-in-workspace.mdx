Logs Management in Portkey enables Organization and Workspace adminis to control who can access logs and log metadata within workspaces. This feature provides granular permissions to protect sensitive information while enabling appropriate visibility for team members.

## Accessing Logs Management
1. Navigate to **Admin Settings** in the Portkey dashboard
2. Select the **Security** tab from the left sidebar
3. Locate the **Logs Management** section

## Permission Settings

The Logs Management section provides four distinct permission options:

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Managers View Logs** | Allow workspace managers to view logs within their workspace |
| **Managers View Logs Metadata** | Allow workspace managers to view logs metadata within their workspace |
| **Members View Logs** | Allow workspace members to view logs within their workspace |
| **Members View Logs Metadata** | Allow workspace members to view logs metadata within their workspace |
