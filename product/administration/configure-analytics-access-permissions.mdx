## Overview

Analytics Management in Portkey enables Organization administrators to control who can view analytics within workspaces. This feature provides granular permissions to restrict analytics visibility for workspace managers and members while keeping full access for organization owners and admins.

## Accessing Analytics Management

1. Navigate to **Admin Settings** in the Portkey dashboard
2. Select the **Security** tab from the left sidebar
3. Locate the **Analytics Management** section

## Permission Settings

The Analytics Management section provides two permission options:

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Managers View Analytics** | Allow workspace managers to view analytics within their workspace |
| **Members View Analytics** | Allow workspace members to view analytics within their workspace |

Both permissions are **enabled by default**.

<Note>
Organization **Owners** and **Admins** always have full access to analytics regardless of these settings.
</Note>

## Workspace-Level Overrides

Analytics access permissions support **workspace-level overrides**, allowing you to configure different analytics access settings per workspace.

When workspace-level overrides are enabled for analytics:
- Each workspace can have its own `membersViewAnalytics` and `managersViewAnalytics` settings
- Workspace settings take precedence over organization-level settings

To configure workspace-level overrides:
1. Enable the **Allow workspace-level configuration** toggle for Analytics in the Security settings
2. Navigate to the specific workspace settings to configure per-workspace analytics access
