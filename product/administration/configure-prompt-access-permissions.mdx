## Overview

Prompt Management in Portkey enables Organization administrators to control who can view and edit prompts within workspaces. This feature provides granular permissions to restrict prompt access for workspace managers and members while keeping full access for organization owners and admins.

## Accessing Prompt Management

1. Navigate to **Admin Settings** in the Portkey dashboard
2. Select the **Security** tab from the left sidebar
3. Locate the **Prompt Management** section

## Permission Settings

The Prompt Management section provides four permission options:

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Managers View Prompts** | Allow workspace managers to view prompts within their workspace |
| **Managers Write Prompts** | Allow workspace managers to create, update, and delete prompts within their workspace |
| **Members View Prompts** | Allow workspace members to view prompts within their workspace |
| **Members Write Prompts** | Allow workspace members to create, update, and delete prompts within their workspace |

**Default settings:**
- Managers can view and write prompts
- Members can view prompts but cannot write

<Note>
Organization **Owners** and **Admins** always have full access to prompts regardless of these settings.
</Note>

## Workspace-Level Overrides

Prompt access permissions support **workspace-level overrides**, allowing you to configure different prompt access settings per workspace.

When workspace-level overrides are enabled for prompts:
- Each workspace can have its own `membersViewPrompts`, `membersWritePrompts`, `managersViewPrompts`, and `managersWritePrompts` settings
- Workspace settings take precedence over organization-level settings

To configure workspace-level overrides:
1. Enable the **Allow workspace-level configuration** toggle for Prompts in the Security settings
2. Navigate to the specific workspace settings to configure per-workspace prompt access
