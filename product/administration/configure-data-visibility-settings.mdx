## Overview

Data Visibility settings in Portkey enable Organization administrators to control whether workspace managers and members can view all observability data (logs, analytics, and traces) within a workspace, or only the data generated by their own API keys. This is useful for teams where individual users should only have visibility into their own requests.

## Accessing Data Visibility Settings

1. Navigate to **Admin Settings** in the Portkey dashboard
2. Select the **Security** tab from the left sidebar
3. Locate the **Data Visibility** section

## Permission Settings

The Data Visibility section provides two permission options:

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Managers View All Data** | Allow workspace managers to view logs, analytics, and traces generated by all users in the workspace |
| **Members View All Data** | Allow workspace members to view logs, analytics, and traces generated by all users in the workspace |

Both permissions are **enabled by default**, meaning all workspace users can see all data.

When a permission is **disabled**, users with that role will only see data generated by their own API keys across logs, analytics, and traces pages.

<Note>
Organization **Owners** and **Admins** always have full access to all data regardless of these settings.
</Note>

## How It Works

When data visibility is restricted for a role:
- **Logs**: The user only sees log entries for requests made with their own API keys
- **Analytics**: Charts and metrics are scoped to the user's own usage
- **Traces**: Only traces initiated by the user's API keys are visible

This restriction applies to both browser sessions and workspace-user API keys. Organization-level and workspace-level service API keys are not affected.

## Workspace-Level Overrides

Data Visibility settings support **workspace-level overrides**, allowing you to configure different data visibility rules per workspace.

When workspace-level overrides are enabled for Data Visibility:
- Each workspace can have its own `membersViewAllData` and `managersViewAllData` settings
- Workspace settings take precedence over organization-level settings
- Workspaces without explicit overrides fall back to the organization-level settings

To configure workspace-level overrides:
1. Enable the **Allow workspace-level configuration** toggle for Data Visibility in the Security settings
2. Navigate to the specific workspace settings to configure per-workspace data visibility
