title: "Enforcing Workspace Level Guardrails"
---

## Overview
Portkey allows workspace owners to enforce request guardrails at the workspace level. This feature ensures that all API requests made within a workspace comply with predefined policies, enhancing security, compliance, and governance at a more granular level.

## How It Works
Workspace owners can define input and output guardrails in the workspace settings. These guardrails are enforced on all API requests made within the workspace, ensuring uniform policy enforcement across all users and applications in that workspace.

- **Input Guardrails**: Define checks and constraints for incoming LLM requests within the workspace.
- **Output Guardrails**: Ensure LLM responses align with the defined guardrail policies.

The guardrails available here are the ones created within the user's workspace. Users can select any of these as the default input/output guardrails for their workspace. Multiple providers are supported for setting up guardrails. For a detailed list of supported providers and configurations:

## Configuration
### Setting Up Workspace-Level Guardrails
1. Head to the Portkey dashboard and navigate to the sidebar.
2. Click on your workspace and select the **Edit (üñäÔ∏è) option**.
3. In the **Edit Workspace** menu:
   - Choose an **Input Guardrail** and  **Output Guardrail** from the options (created in the workspace) .
4. Save your changes.

Once configured, these guardrails will be enforced on all API requests within the workspace.

<Note>
**Best Practices**
- Clearly communicate guardrail requirements to all members in your workspace.
- Maintain internal documentation on your workspace guardrail policies to ensure consistency.
