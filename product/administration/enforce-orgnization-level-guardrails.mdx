title: "Enforcing Org Level Guardrails"
---
## Overview
Portkey enables organization owners to enforce request guardrails at the organization level. This feature ensures that all API requests made within the organization comply with predefined policies, enhancing security, compliance, and governance.

## How It Works
Organization owners can define input and output guardrails in the Organization Guardrails section. These guardrails are enforced on all API requests made within the organization, ensuring uniform policy enforcement across all users and applications.

- **Input Guardrails**: Define checks and constraints for incoming LLM requests.
- **Output Guardrails**: Ensure LLM responses align with organizational policies.

The guardrails available here are the same as those found in the Guardrails section of the Portkey platform. Multiple providers are supported for setting up guardrails. For a detailed list of supported providers and configurations

## Configuration
### Setting Up Guardrails Requirements
1. Head to `Admin Settings` on the Portkey dashboard
2. Navigate to the `Organisation Guardrails` section
3. Add your `Input` and/or `Output` Guardrails
4. Save your changes

Once configured, these guardrails will be enforced on all API requests across the organization.



<Note>
Best Practices
- Clearly communicate guardrail requirements to all developers in your organization.
- Maintain internal documentation on your guardrail policies to ensure consistency.
