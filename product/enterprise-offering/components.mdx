title: "Enterprise Components"
---

Portkey's Enterprise Components provide the core infrastructure needed for production deployments. Each component handles a specific function - analytics, logging, or caching - with multiple implementation options to match your requirements.

---

## Analytics Store

Portkey leverages Clickhouse as the primary Analytics Store for the Control Panel, offering powerful capabilities for handling large-scale analytical workloads.

<Note>
  Portkey supports exporting your Clickhouse analytics data to OpenTelemetry (OTEL) compatible collectors, allowing you to integrate Portkey's analytics with your existing observability infrastructure.

## Log Store

Portkey provides flexible options for storing and managing logs in your enterprise deployment. Choose from various storage solutions including MongoDB for document-based storage, AWS S3 for cloud-native object storage, or Wasabi for cost-effective cloud storage. Each option offers different benefits in terms of scalability, cost, and integration capabilities.

## Cache Store

Portkey supports robust caching solutions to optimize performance and reduce latency in your enterprise deployment. Choose between Redis for in-memory caching or AWS ElastiCache for a fully managed caching service.

## Semantic Cache Store

Portkey supports semantic caching capabilities that allow for intelligent caching based on the semantic meaning of requests rather than exact matches. For this functionality, Portkey requires a vector database to efficiently store and retrieve embeddings. Both Milvus and Pinecone are supported vector databases for Portkey's semantic cache implementation.


- You need a **Milvus** deployment with a collection configured with 1536 dimensions

- **Pinecone** can be configured with a Pinecone index of 1536 dimensions to store the embeddings

This specific dimension size is required as Portkey uses OpenAI's text-embedding-small model to create embeddings
