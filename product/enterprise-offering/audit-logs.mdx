## Overview

Audit Logs in Portkey provide a comprehensive record of all administrative activities across your organization. These logs capture detailed information about who performed what actions, on which resources, and when those actions occurred. This level of visibility is crucial for security monitoring, compliance requirements, and troubleshooting operational issues.
