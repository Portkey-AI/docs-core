Portkey Control plane supports following authentication protocols for enterprise customers.
1. **OIDC** (OpenID Connect) 
2. **SAML 2.0** (Security Assertion Markup Language)  

Below are the steps to integrate your identity provider with our system.

<Info>
**Auto-Provisioning**: First-time SSO users are automatically provisioned to your organization when they log in. If a user has a pending invite, it will be automatically accepted during their first SSO login.
