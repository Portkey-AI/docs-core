This guide will walk you through integrating SCIM with your identity provider to manage users and workspaces seamlessly.

## What is SCIM?

SCIM is an open standard that allows organizations to automate the management of user identities and groups across applications. By integrating with SCIM, you can:

- Automatically provision and update user accounts.
- Deprovision users when they leave your organization.
- Sync user attributes and workspace memberships.

## SCIM Base URL

To integrate SCIM with our platform, get the SCIM Base URL from Portkey Control Plane.

`Admin Settings > Authentication Settings > SCIM Provisioning > SCIM URL`

## Authentication

We use **Bearer Token Authentication** for SCIM requests. 

You need to generate an **API token** from Portkey Control Plane (``Admin Settings > Authentication Settings > SCIM Provisioning`) and use it as a bearer token in the SCIM requests.

You need to include the following header in the SCIM requests:
```
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-token>
```

## Supported Operations

Our SCIM implementation supports the following operations:

| Operation      | Supported |
|----------------|-----------|
| User Provisioning | ✅ |
| User Deprovisioning | ✅ |
| User Updates | ✅ |
| Group (Workspace) Provisioning | ✅ |
| Group (Workspace) Updates | ✅ |
| Group (Workspace) Deprovisioning | ✅ |

## Required Configuration

Before integrating SCIM, ensure you have the following details:

- **SCIM Base URL**: Provided above.
- **Bearer Token**: Generate this token from our platform’s **API Settings** section.

You will need to provide these details in your identity provider's SCIM configuration section.

## Identity Provider Setup

Follow your identity provider's documentation to set up SCIM integration. Below are the key fields you’ll need to configure:

| Field              | Value                      |
|-------------------- |---------------------------|
| SCIM Base URL       | `<SCIM Base URL>` |
| Bearer Token        | `<your-api-token>`         |

Currently, we support SCIM provisioning for the following identity providers:

- [Azure AD](./azure-ad)
- [Okta](./okta)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Invalid Token**: Ensure the bearer token is correctly generated and included in the request header.
- **403 Forbidden**: Check if the provided SCIM Base URL and token are correct.
- **User Not Provisioned**: Ensure the user attributes meet our platform's requirements.
