    Setting up Azure Entra for SCIM provisioning consists of the following steps:

    - **New Entra Application & SCIM Provisioning**
    - **Application Roles**
    - **SCIM Attribute Mapping Update**

---

##### New Entra Application

First, create a new Azure Entra application to set up SCIM provisioning with Portkey.

1. Navigate to the [Entra Applications Page](https://entra.microsoft.com/?culture=en-in&country=in#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/AppGalleryBladeV2) and click **`Create your own application`**.

2. Complete the required fields to create a new application.  
3. Once the application is created, navigate to the application's **Provisioning** page under the **Manage** section.
4. Click **`New Configuration`** to go to the provisioning settings page.

5. Obtain the **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token** from the Portkey Admin Settings page (if SCIM is enabled for your organization).  
    - [Portkey Settings Page](https://app.portkey.ai/settings/organisation/sso)

6. Fill in the values from the Portkey dashboard in Entra's provisioning settings and click **`Test Connection`**. If successful, click **`Create`**.
> If the test connection returns any errors, please contact us at [support@portkey.ai](mailto:support@portkey.ai).

##### Application Roles

Portkey supported roles should match Entra's application roles.

1. Navigate to **App Registrations** under **Enterprise Applications**, click **All Applications**, and select the application created earlier.
2. Go to the **App Roles** page and click **`Create app role`**.
    > Portkey supports two application-level roles:  
    > - **`member`**  (Organization Member)
    > - **`admin`**  (Organization Admin)
    > - **`owner`**  (Organization Owner)

   > Users assigned any other role will default to the **member** role.

3. To support group roles, create a role with the value **`group`** and a name in title-case (e.g., `Group` for the value `group`).

4. Assign users to the application with the desired role (e.g., **`owner`**, **`member`**, or **`admin`**) for the organization.

###### Removing Unnecessary Attributes

Delete the following unsupported attributes:
- **preferredLanguage**
- **addresses (all fields)**

2. Save the changes and enable provisioning on the **Overview** page of the provisioning settings.

<Tip>Looking for Workspace Management? Check out our [Workspace Management](/product/enterprise-offering/org-management/scim/group-management) page.</Tip>


##### Group (Workspace) Provisioning

Portkey supports RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for workspaces mapped to groups in Entra. You have two options for mapping groups to workspaces:

**Option 1: Flexible Group Mapping (Recommended)**

Provision groups with any naming convention from Azure Entra, then map them to workspaces and assign roles directly from Portkey Control Plane. This eliminates the need for specific naming formats.

1. Provision your groups from Azure Entra (assign groups to the application)
2. Navigate to **Admin Settings > Authentication Settings > SCIM Provisioning** in Portkey
3. Use the **SCIM Mappings List** section to map groups to workspaces and assign roles

For detailed instructions, see the [SCIM Group Management](/product/enterprise-offering/org-management/scim/group-management) guide.

<Info>
This is the recommended approach as it provides flexibility in group naming and easier management of group-to-workspace mappings.
</Info>

**Option 2: Naming Convention (Legacy)**

Alternatively, you can use the following naming convention for automatic mapping:

- **Format:** `ws-{group}-role-{role}`  
    - **Role:** One of `admin`, `member`, or `manager`
- A user should belong to only one group per `{group}`.

**Example:**
For a `Sales` workspace:
- `ws-Sales-role-admin`
- `ws-Sales-role-manager`
- `ws-Sales-role-member`

Users assigned to these groups will inherit the corresponding role in Portkey.
