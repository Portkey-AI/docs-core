title: OTel Integration (Analytics Data)
---

 Portkey supports sending your Analytics data to OpenTelemetry (OTel) compatible collectors, allowing you to integrate Portkey's analytics with your existing observability infrastructure.

 ## Overview

 While Portkey leverages Clickhouse as the primary Analytics Store for the Control Panel by default, enterprise customers can integrate Portkey's analytics data with their existing data infrastructure through OpenTelemetry.

 ## Configuration

 Portkey supports pushing your analytics data to an OTEL compatible endpoint. The following environment variables are needed for pushing to OTEL:

 ```yaml
 OTEL_PUSH_ENABLED: true
 OTEL_ENDPOINT: http://localhost:4318
 ```

 Additionally, you can configure arbitrary resource attributes of the OTEL logs by setting a comma-separated value for `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`:

 ```
 OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES: ApplicationShortName=gateway,AssetId=12323,deployment.service=production
 ```

 ## Integration Options

 Enterprise customers commonly use these analytics exports with:

 - **Datadog**: Monitor and analyze your AI operations alongside other application metrics
 - **AWS S3**: Store analytics data for long-term retention and analysis
 - **Other OTEL-compatible systems**: Any system that can ingest OpenTelemetry data can be used with this feature

 ## Use Cases

 This feature enables:

 - Centralized observability across your entire tech stack
 - Long-term storage of analytics data
 - Custom analytics dashboards in your preferred tools
 - Integration with existing alerting systems
