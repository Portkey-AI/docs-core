description: Export Portkey analytics data to OpenTelemetry-compatible collectors for centralized observability
---

Portkey supports sending your Analytics data to OpenTelemetry (OTel) compatible collectors, allowing you to integrate Portkey's analytics with your existing observability infrastructure.

## Overview

While Portkey leverages Clickhouse as the primary Analytics Store for the Control Panel by default, enterprise customers can integrate Portkey's analytics data with their existing data infrastructure through OpenTelemetry.

This export focuses on **aggregated metrics and analytics data** such as:

- Request counts and latency metrics
- Token usage statistics
- Cost tracking data
- Error rates and status codes

<Note>
  For exporting complete request/response logs with full prompt and completion content, see [Complete Logs Export](/product/enterprise-offering/otel/complete-logs).
</Note>

## Configuration

Portkey supports pushing your analytics data to an OTel compatible endpoint. The following environment variables are needed for pushing to OTel:

```yaml
OTEL_PUSH_ENABLED: true
OTEL_ENDPOINT: http://localhost:4318
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS: x-api-key=my-api-key,x-another-header=value
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `OTEL_PUSH_ENABLED` | Yes | Set to `true` to enable analytics export |
| `OTEL_ENDPOINT` | Yes | The OTLP endpoint URL |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` | No | Comma-separated headers in `key=value` format |

### Resource Attributes

You can configure arbitrary resource attributes of the OTel logs by setting a comma-separated value for `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`:

```yaml
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME: portkey-gateway
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES: ApplicationShortName=gateway,AssetId=12323,deployment.service=production
```

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | Service name for the telemetry data |
| `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` | Comma-separated key=value pairs for additional resource attributes |

## Integration Options

Enterprise customers commonly use these analytics exports with:

- **Datadog**: Monitor and analyze your AI operations alongside other application metrics
- **AWS S3**: Store analytics data for long-term retention and analysis
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: Build custom dashboards and alerting
- **Splunk**: Integrate with existing SIEM infrastructure
- **Other OTel-compatible systems**: Any system that can ingest OpenTelemetry data
