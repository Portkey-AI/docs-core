<Info>
This feature is available on all plans.
* **Developer**: Access to `BASIC` Guardrails
* **Production**: Access to `BASIC`, `PARTNER`, `PRO` Guardrails.
* **Enterprise**: Access to **all** Guardrails plus `custom` Guardrails.
</Info>

LLMs are brittle - not just in API uptimes or their inexplicable `400`/`500` errors, but also in their core behavior. You can get a response with a `200` status code that completely errors out for your app's pipeline due to mismatched output. With Portkey's Guardrails, we now help you enforce LLM behavior in real-time with our _Guardrails on the Gateway_ pattern.

Use Portkey's Guardrails to verify your LLM inputs AND outputs, adhering to your specifed checks. Since Guardrails are built on top of our [Gateway](https://github.com/portkey-ai/gateway), you can orchestrate your request - with actions ranging from _denying the request_, _logging the guardrail result_, _creating an evals dataset_, _falling back to another LLM or prompt_, _retrying the request_, and more.

#### Examples of Guardrails Portkey offers:

* **Regex match** \- Check if the request or response text matches a regex pattern
* **JSON Schema** \- Check if the response JSON matches a JSON schema
* **Contains Code** \- Checks if the content contains code of format SQL, Python, TypeScript, etc.
* **Custom guardrail** \- If you are running a custom guardrail currently, you can also integrate it with Portkey
* ...and many more.

Portkey currently offers 20+ deterministic guardrails like the ones described above as well as LLM-based guardrails like `Detect Gibberish`, `Scan for prompt injection`, and more. These guardrails serve as protective barriers that help mitigate risks associated with Gen AI, ensuring its responsible and ethical deployment within organizations.

<Info>
	Portkey also integrates with your favourite Guardrail platforms like [Aporia](https://www.aporia.com/), [SydeLabs](https://sydelabs.ai/), [Pillar Security](https://www.pillar.security/) and more. Just add their API keys to Portkey and you can enable their guardrails policies on your Portkey calls! [More details on Guardrail Partners here.](/product/guardrails/list-of-guardrail-checks)

## Using Guardrails

Putting Portkey Guardrails in production is just a 4-step process:

1. Create Guardrail Checks
2. Create Guardrail Actions
3. Enable Guardrail through Configs
4. Attach the Config to a Request

This flowchart shows how Portkey processes a Guardrails request:
<img src="/images/guardrails/flow.webp" / >

Let's see in detail below:

<Note>
  Portkey only evaluates the last message in the request body when running guardrails checks.
</Note>
---

## 1\. Create a New Guardrail & Add Checks

On the `Guardrails` page, click on `Create` and add your preferred Guardrail checks from the right sidebar.

<Info>

	On Portkey, you can configure Guardrails to be run on either the `INPUT` (i.e. `PROMPT`) or the `OUTPUT`. Hence, for the Guardrail you create, make sure your Guardrail is only validating **ONLY ONE OF** the **Input** or the **Output**.
</Info>

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product/ai-gateway/ai-32.gif"/>
</Frame>

Each Guardrail Check has a custom input field based on its usecase â€” just add the relevant details to the form and save your check.

<Info>

* You can add as many checks as you want to a single Guardrail.
* A check ONLY returns a boolean (`Yes`/`No`) verdict.
</Info>

## 2\. Add Guardrail Actions

Define a basic orchestration logic for your Guardrail here.

<Info>
	Guardrail is created to validate **ONLY ONE OF** the `Input` or the `Output`. The Actions set here will also apply only to either the `request` or the `response`.

### There are 6 Types of Guardrail Actions

| Action         | State                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Impact                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **Async**      | **TRUE** This is the **default** state  | Run the Guardrail checks **asynchronously** along with the LLM request.                                                                                                                                                                             | Will add no latency to your requestUseful when you only want to log guardrail checks without affecting the request                                                                          |

| **Deny**       | **TRUE**                               | **On Request & Response** If any of the Guardrail checks **FAIL**, the request will be killed with a **446** status code. If all of the Guardrail checks **SUCCEED**, the request/response will be sent further with a **200** status code.          | This is useful when your Guardrails are critical and upon them failing, you can not run the requestWe would advice running this action on a subset of your requests to first see the impact |
| **Deny**       | **FALSE** This is the **default** state | **On Request & Response** If any of the Guardrail checks **FAIL**, the request will STILL be sent, but with a **246** status code. If all of the Guardrail checks **SUCCEED**, the request/response will be sent further with a **200** status code. | This is useful when you want to log the Guardrail result but do not want it to affect your result                                                                                           |
| **On Success** | **Send Feedback**                      | If **all of the** Guardrail checks **PASS**, append your custom defined feedback to the request                                                                                                                                                     | We recommend setting up this actionThis will help you build an "Evals dataset" of Guardrail results on your requests over time                                                              |
| **On Failure** | **Send Feedback**                      | If **any of the** Guardrail checks **FAIL**, append your custom feedback to the request                                                                                                                                                             | We recommend setting up this actionThis will help you build an "Evals dataset" of Guardrail results on your requests over time                                                              |

Set the relevant actions you want with your checks, name your Guardrail and save it! When you save the Guardrail, you will get an associated `$Guardrail_ID` that you can then add to your request.

---

## 3\. "Enable" the Guardrails through Configs

This is where Portkey's magic comes into play. The Guardrail you created above is yet not an `Active` guardrail because it is not attached to any request.

Configs is one of Portkey's most powerful features and is used to define all kinds of request orchestration - everything from caching, retries, fallbacks, timeouts, to load balancing.

<Info>

	Now, you can use Configs to add **Guardrail checks** & **actions** to your request.
</Info>




### Option 1: Direct Guardrail Configuration (Recommended)

Portkey now offers a more intuitive way to add guardrails to your configurations:

| Config Key           | Value                                 | Description                                                      |
|:---------------------|:--------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **input_guardrails** | `["guardrails-id-xxx", "guardrails-id-yyy"]` | Apply these guardrails to the **INPUT** before sending to LLM |
| **output_guardrails**| `["guardrails-id-xxx", "guardrails-id-yyy"]` | Apply these guardrails to the **OUTPUT** from the LLM       |

```json
{
  "retry": {
    "attempts": 3
  },
  "cache": {
    "mode": "simple"
  },
  "virtual_key": "openai-xxx",
  "input_guardrails": ["guardrails-id-xxx", "guardrails-id-yyy"],
  "output_guardrails": ["guardrails-id-xxx", "guardrails-id-yyy"]
}
```

### Option 2: Hook-Based Configuration (For Creating [Raw Guardrails](/product/guardrails/creating-raw-guardrails-in-json))

You can also continue to use the original hook-based approach:

| Type                | Config Key                | Value                       | Description                                                           |
|:------------------- |:--------------------------|:----------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Before Request Hook | **before_request_hooks**  | `[{"id":"$guardrail_id"}]`  | These hooks run on the **INPUT** before sending to the LLM            |
| After Request Hook  | **after_request_hooks**   | `[{"id":"$guardrail_id"}]`  | These hooks run on the **OUTPUT** after receiving from the LLM        |


```json
{
  "retry": {
    "attempts": 3
  },
  "cache": {
    "mode": "simple"
  },
  "virtual_key": "openai-xxx",
  "before_request_hooks": [{
    "id": "input-guardrail-id-xx"
  }],
  "after_request_hooks": [{
    "id": "output-guardrail-id-xx"
  }]
}
```

<Note>
Both configuration approaches work identically - choose whichever is more intuitive for your team. The simplified `input_guardrails` and `output_guardrails` fields are recommended for better readability.
</Note>

### Guardrail Behaviour on the Gateway

For **asynchronous** guardrails (`async= TRUE`), Portkey returns the standard, default status codes from the LLM providers â€” this is because the Guardrails verdict is not affecting how you orchestrate your requests. Portkey will only log the Guardrail result for you.

But for **synchronous** requests (`async= FALSE`), Portkey can orchestrate your requests based on the Guardrail verdict. The behaviour is dependent on the following:

* Guardrail Check Verdict (`PASS` or `FAIL`) AND
* Guardrail Action â€” DENY Setting (`TRUE` or `FALSE`)

Portkey sends different `request status codes` corresponding to your set Guardrail behaviour.

For requests where `async= FALSE`:

| Guardrail Verdict | DENY Setting | Returned Status Code | Description                                                                                                                              |
| :----------------- | :------------ | :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PASS**          | **FALSE**    | **200**              | Guardrails have **passed**, request will be processed regardless                                                                         |
| **PASS**          | **TRUE**     | **200**              | Guardrails have **passed**, request will be processed regardless                                                                         |
| **FAIL**          | **FALSE**    | **246**              | Guardrails have **failed**, but the request should still **be processed.**Portkey introduces a new Status code to indicate this state.   |
| **FAIL**          | **TRUE**     | **446**              | Guardrails have **failed**, and the request should **not** **be processed.**Portkey introduces a new Status code to indicate this state. |

### Example Config Using the New `246` & `446` Status Codes


<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Fallback to Another Model on Guardrail Fail">
```json
{
  "strategy": {
    "mode": "fallback",
    "on_status_codes": [246, 446]
  },
  "targets": [
    {"virtual_key": "openai-key-xxx"},
    {"virtual_key": "anthropic-key-xxx"}
  ],
  "input_guardrails": ["guardrails-id-xxx"]
}
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Retry on Guardrail Fail (Simplified)">

    "on_status_codes": [246],
    "attempts": 5
  },

}
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


Create these Configs in Portkey UI, save them, and get an associated Config ID to attach to your requests. [More here](/product/ai-gateway/configs).

## 4\. Final Step - Attach Config to Request

Now, while instantiating your Portkey client or while sending headers, just pass the Config ID.

##  Viewing Guardrail Results in Portkey Logs

Portkey Logs will show you detailed information about Guardrail results for each request.

### On the `Feedback & Guardrails` tab on the log drawer, you can see

#### Guardrail Details

* **Overview**: How many checks `passed` and how many `failed`
* **Verdict**: Guardrail verdict for each of the checks in your Guardrail
* **Latency**: Round trip time for each check in your Guardrail

#### Feedback Details

Portkey will also show the feedback object logged for each request

* `Value`:** The numerical feedback value you passed
* `Weight`: The numerical feedback weight
* `Metadata Key & Value`:** Any custom metadata sent with the feedback
* `successfulChecks`: Which checks associated with this request `passed`
* `failedChecks`: Which checks associated with this request `failed`
* `erroredChecks`: If there were any checks that errored out along the way

## Understanding Guardrail Response Structure

When Guardrails are enabled and configured to run synchronously (`async=false`), Portkey adds a `hook_results` object to your API responses. This object provides detailed information about the guardrail checks that were performed and their outcomes.

### Hook Results Structure

The `hook_results` object contains two main sections:

```json
"hook_results": {
  "before_request_hooks": [...],  // Guardrails applied to the input
  "after_request_hooks": [...]    // Guardrails applied to the output
}
```

Each section contains an array of guardrail execution results, structured as follows:

<Expandable title="Hook Result Object Structure">
  <ResponseField name="verdict" type="boolean">
    Overall verdict of this guardrail (true = passed, false = failed). Only true if all checks within this guardrail passed.
  </ResponseField>

  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="transformed" type="boolean">
    Indicates if the guardrail modified the request or response (e.g., PII redaction)
  </ResponseField>

      </ResponseField>
      <ResponseField name="execution_time" type="number">
        Time taken to execute this check in milliseconds

      <ResponseField name="created_at" type="string">
        Timestamp when the check was executed
      </ResponseField>
      <ResponseField name="log" type="string|null">

### Example Hook Results

Here's a simplified example of what the `hook_results` might look like in a response:

```json [expandable]
"hook_results": {
    "before_request_hooks": [
        {
            "verdict": true,
            "id": "sentence_and_word_check_guardrail",
            "transformed": false,
            "checks": [
                {
                    "data": {
                        "sentenceCount": 1,
                        "minCount": 1,
                        "maxCount": 99999,
                        "not": false,
                        "verdict": true,
                        "explanation": "The sentence count (1) is within the specified range of 1 to 99999.",
                        "textExcerpt": "when does the flight from new york to bengaluru land tomorrow, what time, what is its flight number,..."
                    },
                    "verdict": true,
                    "id": "default.sentenceCount",
                    "execution_time": 0,
                    "transformed": false,
                    "created_at": "2025-05-20T08:00:59.492Z",
                    "log": null

This example corresponds to a `config` like:
```json
{
  "input_guardrails": [
    "sentence_and_word_check_guardrail",  // Contains sentenceCount and wordCount checks
    "characer_check_guardrail"  // Contains characterCount check
  ],
  "output_guardrails": [
    "sentence_and_word_check_guardrail"   // The same guardrail can be used for both input and output
  ]
}
```
### Important Notes

- If a guardrail is configured to run asynchronously (`async=true`), the `hook_results` will not appear in the API response. The results will only be available in the Portkey logs.
- The `data` field varies based on the type of guardrail check being performed. Each guardrail type returns different information relevant to its function.
- The overall `verdict` for a guardrail is `true` only if all individual checks pass. If any check fails, the verdict will be `false`.
- When `transformed` is `true`, it indicates that the guardrail has modified the content (such as redacting PII).
- If `deny` is `true` and the verdict is `false`, the request will be denied with a 446 status code.

### Special Fields

- **Check-specific data**: Each guardrail type provides different data in the `data` field. For example, a sentence count check provides information about the number of sentences, while a PII check might provide information about detected PII entities.
- **Feedback metadata**: The `metadata` object within `feedback` keeps track of which checks were successful, failed, or encountered errors.














## Defining Guardrails Directly in JSON

On Portkey, you can also create the Guardrails in code and add them to your Configs. Read more about this here:

<Card title="Creating Raw Guardrails (in JSON" href="/product/guardrails/creating-raw-guardrails-in-json"/>

---



## Bring Your Own Guardrails

If you already have a custom guardrail pipeline where you send your inputs/outputs for evaluation, you can integrate it with Portkey using a modular, custom webhook! Read more here:

<Card title="Bring Your Own Guardrails" href="/product/guardrails/list-of-guardrail-checks/bring-your-own-guardrails"/>

## Examples of When to Deny Requests with Guardrails

1. **Prompt Injection Checks**: Preventing inputs that could alter the behavior of the AI model or manipulate its responses.
2. **Moderation Checks**: Ensuring responses do not contain offensive, harmful, or inappropriate content.
3. **Compliance Checks**: Verifying that inputs and outputs comply with regulatory requirements or organizational policies.
4. **Security Checks**: Blocking requests that contain potentially harmful content, such as SQL injection attempts or cross-site scripting (XSS) payloads.

By appropriately configuring Guardrail Actions, you can maintain the integrity and reliability of your AI app, ensuring that only safe and compliant requests are processed.
