title: Authorization
description: Control what users can access at the MCP server and tool level.
---

Authorization determines what authenticated users can access. While [authentication](/product/mcp-gateway/authentication) verifies *who* a user is, authorization controls *what* they can do.

<Info>
Authorization features are being actively developed. This page covers current capabilities and upcoming features.

## Authorization layers

MCP Gateway provides authorization at multiple levels:

| Level | What it controls | Status |
|-------|------------------|--------|
| **Workspace** | Which teams can access which MCP servers | Available |
| **MCP Server** | Access to specific servers based on claims | Available |
| **Tool** | Access to specific tools within a server | Coming soon |

---

## Claim-Based Authorization

Control access based on JWT claims. Route users to appropriate servers based on group membership, roles, or other attributes.

### Server-level claims

Authorize access to an MCP server based on claims in the user's JWT:

```json
{
  "authorization": {
    "required_claims": {
      "groups": {
        "values": ["engineering", "platform"],
        "match_type": "contains"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Users without the required claims receive an authorization error.

### Match types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `exact` | Claim value must match exactly |
| `contains` | Claim must include at least one value |
| `containsAll` | Claim must include all values |
| `regex` | Match against a regular expression |

## Tool-Level Authorization

<Note>
Tool-level claim-based authorization is coming in a future release.
</Note>

Fine-grained authorization at the tool level based on JWT claims. Control tool access by user attributes:

```json
{
  "tool_authorization": {
    "delete_issue": {
      "required_claims": {
        "role": {
          "values": ["admin", "maintainer"],
          "match_type": "contains"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This enables scenarios like:
- Allow read tools for all users, write tools for specific roles
- Restrict dangerous operations to admins
- Enable different tool sets for different teams

---

## Webhooks for Authorization

<Note>
Webhook-based authorization is coming in a future release.
</Note>

Call your custom authorization service before each MCP request. Implement dynamic, context-aware access decisions.

```json
{
  "authorization_webhook": {
    "url": "https://your-service.com/authorize",
    "timeout_ms": 1000,
    "on_error": "deny"
  }
}
```

Your webhook receives:
- User identity and claims
- Target MCP server
- Tool being called
- Request parameters

Return `allow` or `deny` with an optional reason.

This enables:
- Dynamic authorization based on external systems
- Context-aware decisions (time of day, request patterns)
- Integration with existing authorization infrastructure
- Custom business logic for access control

---

## Combining with Team Provisioning

Authorization works alongside [Team Provisioning](/product/mcp-gateway/access-control):

1. **Team Provisioning** controls which workspaces see which servers
2. **Authorization** adds claim-based rules on top

A user must pass both checks to access an MCP server or tool.
