title: MCP Clients

Portkey makes it simple to integrate with MCP clients by connecting directly to your MCP servers and handling authentication automatically.

With Portkey, you can connect any server registered on Portkey’s MCP Hub using just a URL—no infrastructure setup, no secret management.

---

## Connecting your MCP Server

Once you’ve connected your MCP server to Portkey, Portkey provides you with a ready-to-use URL. For example:

```
https://mcp.portkey.ai/:workspace-id/:mcp-server-id/mcp
````

That’s all you need to connect Portkey to any MCP client.

You can simply add your MCO server configuration using JSON in your desired application:


Add this configuration to your Claude or other MCP client settings.

```json Mac/Linux
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "portkey-mcp": {
      "enabled": true,
      "command": "npx",
      "source": "custom",
      "args": [
        "https://mcp.portkeydev.com/ws-shared-r43vt4/linear-be8562/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}




```

```json Windows
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "portkey-mcp": {
      "enabled": true,
      "command": "npx",
      "source": "custom",
      "args": [
        "https://mcp.portkeydev.com/ws-shared-r43vt4/linear-be8562/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

```json WSL
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "portkey-mcp": {
      "enabled": true,
      "command": "npx",
      "source": "custom",
      "args": [
        "https://mcp.portkeydev.com/ws-shared-r43vt4/linear-be8562/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Example: Connecting to Cursor

1. Open Cursor:
   **Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P → View: Open MCP settings**

2. Click **Add a new MCP server**. This opens your MCP JSON.

3. Modify the JSON like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server1": {
      "url": "https://mcp.portkey.ai/:workspace-id/:mcp-server-id/mcp"
    },
    "server2": {
      "url": "https://mcp.portkey.ai/:workspace-id/:mcp-server-id/mcp"
    }
  }
}
````

4. Note that Portkey manages authentication end to end. If the upstream MCP server requires auth, Portkey will prompt the user to allow access and then complete the auth flow with that server.

That’s it—you’ve added a Portkey MCP server to Cursor in just a few steps.



This keeps the developer experience extremely clean while maintaining granular access control and authentication.
