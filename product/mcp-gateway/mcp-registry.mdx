The MCP Registry is the central catalog of all MCP server integrations in your organization. Organization admins add servers here, configure authentication, and control which teams can access them.

<Info>
**Developer note:** Most developers won't add servers here. After an org admin provisions a server, use it from the **workspace MCP page** to copy the connection URL and test tools.
</Info>

The MCP Registry supports:
- Adding MCP servers (from catalog or custom URL)
- Configuring authentication for each server
- Viewing connection status and health metrics
- Controlling which teams access which servers
- Managing capabilities (tools, resources, prompts) per server

## Adding Servers

Click **MCP Registry** in the sidebar, then click **Add MCP Server**.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Name | Display name for the server |
| Slug | URL-friendly identifier (e.g., `linear`, `internal-api`) |
| Server URL | MCP endpoint (e.g., `https://mcp.linear.app/mcp`) |
| Server Type | `HTTP` for remote servers |
| Auth Type | Authentication method (see below) |

<Note>
Portkey supports remote MCP servers over HTTP. Local STDIO servers need to be exposed as HTTP endpoints first.
</Note>

---

## Authentication

<Info>
This section covers how Portkey authenticates to **upstream MCP servers**. For how your agents and MCP clients authenticate to Portkey, see [Gateway Authentication](/product/mcp-gateway/authentication).
</Info>

When adding a server, choose the auth method based on what the MCP server supports:

| Auth Type | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| **None** | Public servers with no authentication required |
| **OAuth 2.1** | Servers with user-level OAuth. Each user gets their own tokens. |
| **Client Credentials** | Servers using OAuth client credentials. Shared across users. |
| **Headers** | Servers using API keys or static tokens. |

**Quick summary:**
- **OAuth (user-level)**: Each user authorizes their own access. Use for servers with user-specific data (Linear, GitHub, Slack).
- **Client Credentials**: Shared OAuth tokens. Use for service accounts or shared resources.
- **Headers**: Static API keys sent with every request. Use for simple token-based auth.

## Server Overview

Once added, each server has a detail page with four tabs: **Overview**, **Capabilities**, **Setup & Code**, and **Access Control & Limits**.

**Overview tab** shows:
- **Server Status**: Health score, uptime, average response time, total requests
- **Security & Authentication**: Auth type, grant type, transport protocol
- **Configuration**: Server URL, version, connection details
