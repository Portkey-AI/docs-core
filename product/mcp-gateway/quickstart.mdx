title: Quickstart
description: Add DeepWiki to Portkey MCP Gateway and connect it to Claude.
---

This quickstart walks you through:

1. Adding the DeepWiki MCP server to your organization's MCP Registry
2. Copying the Portkey MCP URL from your workspace
3. Using the URL in Claude (Desktop / Code) via MCP configuration

<Info>
**Who does what:** MCP integrations can be added by **org admin and members**. The MCP server can be used by **workspace admin, manager, and members**.
</Info>

## 1) Add DeepWiki to MCP Registry

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open MCP Registry">
    Go to **MCP Registry** in your org settings, then click **Add Server**.

    <Frame>
      <img src="../../MCP Design Files (11)/With Data.png" alt="MCP Registry list with Add Server button" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill in the server details">
    Enter the following:

    | Field | Value |
    |-------|-------|
    | **Name** | `deepwiki-test-mcp-server` |
    | **Short Description** | A short note about the MCP Integration |
    | **URL** | `https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp` |
    | **Slug** | `deepwiki-test-mcp-server` |
    | **Server Type** | Http |
    | **Auth Type** | None |

    <Note>
    DeepWiki is a public MCP server that doesn't require authentication, so you can set **Auth Type** to `None`. Learn more about [DeepWiki MCP](https://docs.devin.ai/work-with-devin/deepwiki-mcp).
    </Note>

    In the same form, you'll see **Workspace Provisioning** settings. Select the workspace(s) that should have access to this MCP server.

    <Frame>
      <img src="../../MCP Design Files (11)/6.png" alt="Provision server access to workspaces" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test & save">
    Click **Test Connection**, then **Add Server**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## 2) Copy the MCP URL from your workspace

Once enabled, go to your workspace's **MCP** page and copy the DeepWiki connection URL.

<Frame>
  <img src="../../MCP Design Files (11)/1.png" alt="Workspace MCP page showing per-server connection URL" />
</Frame>

The URL will look like:

```
https://mcp.portkey.ai/deepwiki-test-mcp-server/mcp
```

---

## 3) Use the URL in Claude (Desktop / Code)

Add a new MCP server that points to the Portkey URL and sends your **Portkey API key** as a header.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "deepwiki": {
      "transport": "sse",
      "url": "https://mcp.portkey.ai/deepwiki-test-mcp-server/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <PORTKEY_API_KEY>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>
Even though DeepWiki doesn't require authentication, Claude still needs your **Portkey API key** to access the server through the gateway.

You can get your Portkey API key at [app.portkey.ai/api-keys](https://app.portkey.ai/api-keys). Make sure to use a **workspace API key** with **`mcp invoke`** permissions.
