<Info>
Guardrails for MCP Gateway is coming soon.
</Info>

Guardrails let you apply policies to MCP requests before and after they execute.

## What's coming

**Pre-execution checks.** Validate tool inputs before they run. Check for sensitive data. Enforce policies before any tool executes.

**Rate limiting.** Limit requests per user, team, or server. Prevent abuse and control costs.

**Content filtering.** Block requests containing sensitive data. Inspect tool outputs for PII or secrets.

**Approval workflows.** Require explicit approval for high-risk operations like deletions or write actions.

**Budget controls.** Limit usage based on cost or request volume.
