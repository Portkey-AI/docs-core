<Note>
The MCP Gateway supports remote MCP servers using HTTP/SSE transport protocols (StreamableHTTP and SSE). If you have a local STDIO-based MCP server that you want to use with the gateway, see our guide on [Converting STDIO MCP Servers to Streamable HTTP](/guides/converting-stdio-to-streamable-http).
</Note>


## Security Architecture
The gateway implements defense-in-depth security:

1. **Client Authentication**: OAuth 2.1 tokens validated on every request
2. **Authorization**: Scope-based access control for MCP operations
3. **Token Isolation**: Client tokens never forwarded to upstream servers
4. **Session Security**: Cryptographically secure session IDs with token-aligned expiration
5. **Transport Security**: TLS encryption for all connections
6. **Audit Logging**: Complete request/response audit trail
