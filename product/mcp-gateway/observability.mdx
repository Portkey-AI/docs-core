Every MCP request through the gateway is logged automatically. No setup required.

## What gets logged

Each request captures:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Tool | Which tool was called |
| Parameters | Request payload |
| Response | Full response data |
| User | Who made the request |
| Team | Which team (workspace) |
| Timestamp | When it happened |
| Latency | How long it took |
| Status | Success or error |
| MCP Server | Which upstream server |

## View logs

Go to **Logs** in the dashboard. Filter by:

- MCP server
- Team
- User
- Tool name
- Time range
- Status (success/error)

Click any entry for full details: the exact request parameters sent, the response received, and timing breakdown.

## Usage analytics

The dashboard shows aggregate metrics:

- Requests over time
- Requests by server
- Requests by team
- Requests by user
- Error rates
- Latency percentiles
- Most used tools

Use these to understand adoption patterns. Which tools are popular? Which teams are using MCP the most? Are error rates increasing?

## Debugging

When something breaks, logs tell you exactly what happened.

**Tool returning errors?** Check the response data. The MCP server's error message is captured.

**Wrong results?** Check the parameters. Maybe the agent sent incorrect arguments.

**Slow responses?** Check the latency breakdown. Is it the MCP server or the network?

**Access denied?** Check the user and team. Do they have permission for this tool?

A typical debugging flow:

1. Filter logs by the user who reported the issue
2. Find the failing request
3. Check parameters and response
4. Identify the root cause

## Metadata

Each request includes rich context from authentication, available for both API key and OAuth flows:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `organisation_id` | Organization identifier |
| `organisation_name` | Organization display name |
| `workspace_id` | Workspace identifier |
| `workspace_name` | Workspace display name |
| `workspace_slug` | Workspace slug |
| `user_id` | User identifier |
| `api_key_id` | API key identifier (if using API key auth) |
| `mcp_server_id` | Which MCP server handled the request |
| `mcp.auth.type` | Authentication method (`api_key` or `Bearer`) |

This metadata enables:
- Per-user usage tracking
- Per-team cost allocation
- Compliance auditing
- Chargeback reporting
- Authentication flow analysis

## Forward metadata to MCP servers

Use [Identity Forwarding](/product/mcp-gateway/authentication/identity-forwarding) to send user context to MCP servers.

The MCP server receives information about who made the request. It can then:
- Log with Portkey context
- Enforce its own access controls
- Personalize responses
- Attribute actions to users

## Integration with AI Gateway

For Portkey AI Gateway users, MCP logs integrate with existing observability:

- Traces span LLM calls and tool use
- Single dashboard for agent activity
- Correlate tool calls with model outputs
- See the full picture of what your agents are doing
