<ComingSoon />

Circuit breakers automatically detect unhealthy upstream MCP servers and fail fast to protect your agents.

## What's coming

- **Automatic detection.** Monitor failure rates and response times.
- **Fast failure.** Stop sending requests to unhealthy servers immediately.
- **Recovery checks.** Periodically test if servers have recovered.
- **Configurable thresholds.** Set failure rate and latency thresholds per server.
- **Status visibility.** See circuit state (closed, open, half-open) in the dashboard.
