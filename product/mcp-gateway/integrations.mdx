description: Connect MCP servers to AI agents and applications.
---

Portkey MCP Gateway works with any MCP client. Connect your agents using a URL and API key.

## Find your connection URL

Go to **MCP** in your workspace sidebar. Click on a server to see its connection details.

Each server has a URL:

```
https://mcp.portkey.ai/{server-slug}/mcp
```

Copy this URL to use in your agent configuration.

<Note>
For self-hosted deployments, replace `mcp.portkey.ai` with your gateway URL.
</Note>

## Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config file.

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linear": {
      "url": "https://mcp.portkey.ai/linear/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after saving. The tools appear in your conversation.

If the server uses OAuth, Claude prompts you to authenticate when you first use a tool.

## Cursor

Open **Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P** > **Cursor Settings: Open MCP Settings**.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linear": {
      "url": "https://mcp.portkey.ai/linear/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The tools are available in Cursor's agent mode.

## VS Code

With GitHub Copilot and the MCP extension:

```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "linear": {
      "url": "https://mcp.portkey.ai/linear/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Python

```bash
pip install mcp
```

```python
from mcp import ClientSession
from mcp.client.streamable_http import streamablehttp_client

url = "https://mcp.portkey.ai/linear/mcp"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY"}

async with streamablehttp_client(url, headers=headers) as (read, write, _):
    async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
        await session.initialize()
        
        # List tools
        tools = await session.list_tools()
        for tool in tools.tools:
            print(f"{tool.name}: {tool.description}")
        
        # Call a tool
        result = await session.call_tool(
            "create_issue",
            {"title": "Bug report", "priority": "high"}
        )
        print(result)
```

## TypeScript

```bash
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
```

```typescript
import { Client } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js";
import { StreamableHTTPClientTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/streamableHttp.js";

const transport = new StreamableHTTPClientTransport(
  new URL("https://mcp.portkey.ai/linear/mcp"),
  {
    requestInit: {
      headers: { "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY" }
    }
  }
);

const client = new Client({ name: "my-agent", version: "1.0.0" });
await client.connect(transport);

const tools = await client.listTools();
console.log(tools);

const result = await client.callTool({
  name: "search_issues",
  arguments: { query: "bug" }
});
console.log(result);
```

## API keys

Create API keys in **Settings > API Keys**. Keys are scoped to teams, so the key determines which MCP servers your agent can access.

## Handling OAuth

If an MCP server uses OAuth for per-user authentication, users need to complete OAuth consent before using tools.

The first time a user calls a tool, Portkey returns an error with an authorization URL. Redirect the user to complete OAuth. After consent, retry the request.

```python
try:
    result = await session.call_tool("get_repos", {})
except Exception as e:
    if "authorization_url" in str(e):
        # Redirect user to authorize
        print(f"Please authorize: {authorization_url}")
```

After authorization, Portkey stores the user's tokens and handles refresh automatically.

## AI Gateway integration

If you use Portkey's AI Gateway for LLM calls, MCP integrates automatically:

- Unified dashboard for LLM and MCP activity
- Traces span model calls and tool use
- Single API key for both services
