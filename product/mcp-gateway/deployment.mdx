## via Portkey Cloud
Portkey hosts the MCP Gateway on our edge network available through `https://mcp.portkey.ai`

The control plane is available on `https://app.portkey.ai` that gives you a UI-friendly way to manage, observe and govern MCP servers and their usage.

## Self-hosted Deployments
For enterprises self-hosting the gateway, the MCP gateway is packaged in the same AI gateway docker deployment.

MCP and AI gateways are exposed through different ports making it easy to map them to different base URLs which is advisable.

We recommend URLs like `https://ai.yourcompanyname.com` for the LLM gateway and `https://mcp.yourcompanyname.com` for the MCP gateway.

The helm chart contains variables to run both or individual servers in your deployment.
