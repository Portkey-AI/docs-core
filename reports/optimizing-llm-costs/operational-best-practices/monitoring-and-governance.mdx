Implementing robust monitoring and governance practices is essential for maintaining control over GenAI usage and costs.

## Key Aspects of Monitoring and Governance

1. **Usage Tracking**: Monitor the number of API calls, token usage, and associated costs for each model and application.
2. **Performance Metrics**: Track response times, error rates, and model accuracy to ensure quality of service.
3. **Cost Allocation**: Implement systems to attribute costs to specific projects, teams, or business units.
4. **Alerting**: Set up alerts for unusual spikes in usage or costs to quickly identify and address issues.
5. **Compliance Monitoring**: Ensure that AI usage adheres to regulatory requirements and internal policies.

## Implementation Example

Here's a basic example using Prometheus and Flask for monitoring:

```python
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import time

app = Flask(__name__)

# Define metrics
API_CALLS = Counter('api_calls_total', 'Total number of API calls', ['model'])
TOKEN_USAGE = Counter('token_usage_total', 'Total number of tokens used', ['model'])
RESPONSE_TIME = Histogram('response_time_seconds', 'Response time in seconds', ['model'])

@app.route('/generate', methods=['POST'])
def generate():
    model_name = request.json['model']
    prompt = request.json['prompt']
    
    API_CALLS.labels(model=model_name).inc()
    
    start_time = time.time()
    response = generate_text(model_name, prompt)  # Your text generation function
    end_time = time.time()
    
    TOKEN_USAGE.labels(model=model_name).inc(len(response.split()))
    RESPONSE_TIME.labels(model=model_name).observe(end_time - start_time)
    
    return jsonify({"response": response})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

By implementing comprehensive monitoring and governance practices, organizations can maintain better control over their LLM usage, optimize costs, and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.
