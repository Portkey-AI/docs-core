Implementing an automated system for model selection and routing can optimize cost and performance based on the specific requirements of each query.

## Key Components

1. **Query Classifier**: Categorize incoming queries based on complexity, domain, etc.
2. **Model Selector**: Choose the appropriate model based on the query classification.
3. **Performance Monitor**: Track the performance of selected models for continuous improvement.

## Implementation Example

Here's a basic example of how you might implement automated model selection and routing:

```python
class ModelRouter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = {
            "simple": SimpleModel(),
            "complex": ComplexModel(),
            "specialized": SpecializedModel()
        }

    def classify_query(self, query):
        # Implement query classification logic
        # This could be based on keywords, length, complexity, etc.
        if len(query.split()) < 10:
            return "simple"
        elif any(keyword in query.lower() for keyword in ["analyze", "compare", "explain"]):
            return "complex"
        else:
            return "specialized"

    def select_model(self, query_type):
        return self.models[query_type]

    def route_query(self, query):
        query_type = self.classify_query(query)
        selected_model = self.select_model(query_type)
        return selected_model.generate(query)

# Usage
router = ModelRouter()
result = router.route_query("What's the capital of France?")
print(result)
```

By implementing automated model selection and routing, organizations can ensure that each query is handled by the most appropriate model, optimizing for both cost and performance.
