A model garden is a curated collection of AI models that developers can access and use within an organization. This approach offers several benefits for managing and optimizing LLM usage.

## Benefits of a Model Garden

1. **Flexibility**: Developers can choose the most appropriate model for each task.
2. **Cost Optimization**: By providing access to a range of models, organizations can ensure that expensive, high-performance models are only used when necessary.
3. **Experimentation**: A model garden facilitates easy testing and comparison of different models.

## Implementing a Model Garden

1. **Model Selection**: Choose a diverse range of models that cover various use cases and performance levels.
2. **API Standardization**: Create a unified API interface for accessing different models.
3. **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation on each model's capabilities, use cases, and cost implications.
4. **Monitoring**: Implement usage tracking to understand which models are being used and for what purposes.

## Example: Simple Model Garden API

Here's a basic example of how you might structure a model garden API:

```python
class ModelGarden:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = {
            "gpt-3": OpenAIModel("gpt-3"),
            "distilbert": HuggingFaceModel("distilbert-base-uncased"),
            "custom-fintuned": CustomModel("path/to/model")
        }

    def generate(self, model_name, prompt):
        if model_name not in self.models:
            raise ValueError(f"Model {model_name} not found in the garden")
        return self.models[model_name].generate(prompt)

# Usage
garden = ModelGarden()
response = garden.generate("distilbert", "Summarize this text:")
```

By implementing a model garden, organizations can provide their developers with a flexible, efficient, and cost-effective way to leverage various AI models in their applications.
