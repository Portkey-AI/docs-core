When working with structured data, optimizing JSON responses can lead to significant token savings.

## Optimization Techniques

1. **Minimize Whitespace**: Remove unnecessary spaces and line breaks.
2. **Use Short Keys**: Opt for concise property names.
3. **Avoid Redundancy**: Don't repeat information that can be inferred.

## Example of Optimizing a JSON Response

Here's an example of how to optimize JSON responses:

```python
def generate_product_info(product_name):
    prompt = f"""
Generate product info for {product_name}.
Return a JSON object with these keys:
n (name), p (price), d (description), f (features).
Minimize whitespace in the JSON.
"""
    return get_completion(prompt)

# Usage
result = generate_product_info("Smartphone X")
print(result)

# Output: {"n":"Smartphone X","p":799,"d":"High-end smartphone with advanced features","f":["5G","OLED display","Triple camera"]}
```

By optimizing JSON responses, developers can significantly reduce token usage when working with structured data, leading to cost savings in LLM applications.
