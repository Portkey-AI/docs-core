Effective prompt engineering can significantly reduce token usage and improve model performance. 

## Key Strategies

1. **Clear and Concise Instructions**: Minimize unnecessary words or context.
2. **Structured Prompts**: Use a consistent format for similar types of queries.
3. **Few-Shot Learning**: Provide relevant examples within the prompt for complex tasks.
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously test and optimize prompts for better performance.

## Example of an Optimized Prompt

Here's an example of how to structure an efficient prompt:

```python
def generate_summary(text):
    prompt = f"""
Summarize the following text in 3 bullet points:
- Focus on key ideas
- Use concise language
- Maintain factual accuracy
Text: {text}
Summary:
"""
    return get_completion(prompt)

# Usage
text = "Your long text here..."
summary = generate_summary(text)
print(summary)
```

By following these prompt engineering strategies, developers can create more efficient and effective interactions with LLMs, reducing costs and improving the quality of outputs.
