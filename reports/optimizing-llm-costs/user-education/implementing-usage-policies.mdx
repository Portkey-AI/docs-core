Establishing clear policies for GenAI usage can help prevent misuse and control costs.

## Key Policy Components

1. Define acceptable use cases and limits for different user roles.
2. Implement approval processes for high-cost or sensitive operations.
3. Set up monitoring and reporting mechanisms to track usage and costs.
4. Establish guidelines for data privacy and ethical AI use.

## Example Policy Framework

```
GenAI Usage Policy

1. Authorized Use Cases:
   - Customer support query generation
   - Internal document summarization
   - Code documentation assistance

2. Usage Limits:
   - Junior staff: Up to 1000 tokens per day
   - Senior staff: Up to 5000 tokens per day
   - Management: Unlimited, subject to monthly review

3. Approval Process:
   - Usage beyond daily limits requires manager approval
   - New use cases must be approved by the AI Ethics Committee

4. Monitoring and Reporting:
   - Weekly usage reports will be generated for each department
   - Monthly cost analysis will be conducted by the Finance team

5. Data Privacy and Ethics:
   - No personal or sensitive information should be input into GenAI systems
   - All outputs must be reviewed for accuracy and bias before external use

6. Training Requirement:
   - All users must complete the "Responsible GenAI Usage" course before access is granted

By implementing clear and comprehensive usage policies, organizations can ensure responsible and cost-effective use of GenAI technologies across their operations.
