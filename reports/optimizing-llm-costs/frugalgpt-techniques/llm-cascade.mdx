title: '3.3 LLM Cascade'
description: 'Dynamically selecting optimal LLMs to balance cost and performance'
---

The LLM cascade technique involves dynamically selecting the optimal set of LLMs to query based on the input. This approach leverages the strengths of different models while managing costs effectively.

## Key Components

1. **Task classifier**: Determines the complexity and nature of the input query.

2. **Model selector**: Chooses the appropriate model(s) based on the task classification.

3. **Confidence evaluator**: Assesses the confidence of each model's output.

4. **Escalation logic**: Decides whether to query a more powerful (and expensive) model based on confidence thresholds.

## Implementation Example

Here's a basic example of implementing an LLM cascade:

```python
def classify_task(query):
    # Implement task classification logic
    pass

def select_model(task_type):
    # Choose appropriate model based on task type
    pass

def evaluate_confidence(model_output):
    # Implement confidence evaluation logic
    pass

def llm_cascade(query):
    task_type = classify_task(query)
    selected_model = select_model(task_type)
    response = selected_model.generate(query)
    confidence = evaluate_confidence(response)
    
    if confidence < CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD:
        # Escalate to more powerful model
        advanced_model = select_advanced_model(task_type)
        response = advanced_model.generate(query)
    
    return response

# Usage
result = llm_cascade("Explain quantum computing in simple terms")
print(result)
```

By implementing an LLM cascade, organizations can optimize their use of different models, ensuring that expensive, high-performance models are only used when necessary.
