## Notes on Common Errors
<Note>
**AB01 – Request Validation Error (400)**

This error usually happens when:
- You're either missing required parameters
- using incorrect data types (e.g., sending a number instead of a string)
- passing values that are not within the allowed set (enum violations).

</Note>




<Note>
**AB05 – Unauthorized Access (401)**

This indicates that the user is not authorized to access the resource, often due to incorrect API key permissions.

**Common Cause**: Your API key does **not have the right permissions** for this request.

**Fix**: Go to [app.portkey.ai](https://app.portkey.ai) → **API Keys**, and check the permissioning for your key. Ensure it includes the required scopes for the endpoint you're calling.
