description: Access any custom provider endpoint through Portkey API
icon: "chart-network"

<Note>
This feature is available on all Portkey plans.
</Note>

Portkey API has first-class support for monitoring and routing your requests to 10+ provider endpoints, like `/chat/completions`, `/audio`, `/embeddings`, etc. We also make these endpoints work across 250+ different LLMs.

**However**, there are still many endpoints like Cohere's `/rerank` or Deepgram's `/listen` that are uncommon or have niche use cases.

With the **Gateway to Other APIs** feature, you can route to any custom provider endpoint using Portkey (including the ones hosted on your private setups) and get **complete logging & monitoring** for all your requests.

## Supported HTTP Methods

<CardGroup cols={4}>
  <Card title="POST" color="#4CAF50" />
  <Card title="GET" color="#2196F3" />
  <Card title="PUT" color="#FF9800" />
  <Card title="DELETE" color="#F44336" />
</CardGroup>

Both the REST API and Portkey SDKs (Python, NodeJS) support all of these HTTP methods.

# How to Integrate

1. Get your Portkey API key
2. Add your provider details to Portkey
3. Make your request using Portkey's API or SDK


## 1. Get Portkey API Key
Create or log in to your Portkey account. Grab your account's API key from the ["API Keys" page](https://app.portkey.ai/api-keys).

## 2. Add Provider Details

Choose one of these authentication methods:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Option 1. Generate a Virtual Key (Recommended)">
Portkey integrates with 40+ LLM providers. Add your provider credentials (such as API key) to Portkey, and get a virtual key that you can use to authenticate and send your requests.

<CodeGroup>

```sh cURL
curl https://api.portkey.ai/v1/rerank \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-portkey-api-key: $PORTKEY_API_KEY" \
  -H "x-portkey-virtual-key: $PORTKEY_PROVIDER" \
```

```py Python
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(
  api_key = "PORTKEY_API_KEY",
  virtual_key = "PROVIDER"
)
```

```ts JavaScript
import Portkey from 'portkey-ai';

const portkey = new Portkey({
  apiKey: 'PORTKEY_API_KEY',
  virtualKey: 'PROVIDER'
});
```
</CodeGroup>
<Note>
Creating virtual keys lets you:
- Manage all credentials in one place
- Rotate between different provider keys
- Set custom budget limits & rate limits per key
</Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Option 2. Direct Provider Auth">
Set the provider name from one of Portkey's 40+ supported providers list and use your provider credentials directly with each request.

<CodeGroup>
```sh cURL
curl https://api.portkey.ai/v1/rerank \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-portkey-api-key: $PORTKEY_API_KEY" \
  -H "x-portkey-provider: cohere" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $COHERE_API_KEY" \
```
```py Python
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(
  api_key = "PORTKEY_API_KEY",
  provider = "cohere",
  Authorization = "Bearer COHERE_API_KEY"
)
```
```ts JavaScript
import Portkey from 'portkey-ai';

const portkey = new Portkey({
  apiKey: 'PORTKEY_API_KEY',
  provider: "cohere",
  Authorization: "Bearer COHERE_API_KEY"
});
```
</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Option 3. Custom Hosted Endpoint">

Route to your privately hosted model endpoints.
- Choose a compatible provider type (e.g., `openai`, `cohere`)
- Provide your endpoint URL with `customHost`
- Include `Authentication` if needed

<CodeGroup>

```sh cURL
curl https://api.portkey.ai/v1/rerank \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-portkey-api-key: $PORTKEY_API_KEY" \
  -H "x-portkey-provider: cohere" \
  -H "x-portkey-custom-host: https://182.145.24.5:8080/v1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $COHERE_API_KEY" \
```

```py Python
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(
  api_key = "PORTKEY_API_KEY",
  provider = "cohere",
  custom_host = "https://182.145.24.5:8080/v1",
  Authorization = "Bearer COHERE_API_KEY"
)
```

```ts JavaScript
import Portkey from 'portkey-ai';

const portkey = new Portkey({
  apiKey: 'PORTKEY_API_KEY',
  provider: "cohere",
  customHost: "https://182.145.24.5:8080/v1",
  Authorization: "Bearer COHERE_API_KEY"
});
```

## 3. Make Requests

<Tabs>
<Tab title="cURL">
Construct your request URL:
1. Portkey Gateway base URL remains same: `https://api.portkey.ai/v1`
2. Append your custom endpoint at the end of the URL: `https://api.portkey.ai/v1/{provider-endpoint}`

<CodeGroup>
```bash POST
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.portkey.ai/v1/rerank \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --header 'x-portkey-api-key: $PORTKEY_API_KEY' \

       "model": "rerank-english-v2.0",
       "query": "What is machine learning?",
       "documents": [
         "Machine learning is a branch of AI focused on building systems that learn from data.",
         "Data science involves analyzing and interpreting complex data sets."
       ]
     }'
```

```bash GET
curl --request GET \
     --url https://api.portkey.ai/v1/collections \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --header 'x-portkey-api-key: $PORTKEY_API_KEY' \

     --data '{
       "metadata": {
         "description": "Updated collection description"
       }
     }'
```

```bash DELETE

     --url https://api.portkey.ai/v1/collections/my-collection \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

## End-to-end Example

# Caveats & Considerations

- Response objects are returned exactly as received from the provider, without Portkey transformations
- REST API supports all HTTP methods: `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`
- SDK supports all HTTP methods: `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`
- There are no limitations on which provider endpoints can be proxied
- All requests are logged and monitored through your Portkey dashboard
