description: Access any custom provider endpoint through Portkey API
icon: "chart-network"
---
<Note>
This feature is available on all Portkey plans.
</Note>

Portkey API has first-class support for monitoring and routing your requests to 10+ provider endpoints, like `/chat/completions`, `/audio`, `/embeddings`, etc. We also make these endpoints work across 250+ different LLMs.

**However**, there are still many endpoints like Cohere's `/rerank` or Deepgram's `/listen` that are uncommon or have niche use cases.

With the **Gateway to Other APIs** feature, you can route to any custom provider endpoint using Portkey (including the ones hosted on your private setups) and get **complete logging  & monitoring** for all your requests.

# How to Integrate

1. Get your Portkey API key
2. Add your provider details to Portkey
3. Make your request using Portkey's API or SDK


## 1. Get Portkey API Key
Create or log in to your Portkey account. Grab your account’s API key from the [“API Keys” page](https://app.portkey.ai/api-keys).

## 2. Add Provider Details

Choose one of these authentication methods:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Option 1. Generate a Virtual Key (Recommended)">
Portkey integrates with 40+ LLM providers. Add your provider credentials (such as API key) to Portkey, and get a virtual key that you can use to authenticate and send your requests.

<CodeGroup>

```sh cURL
curl https://api.portkey.ai/v1/rerank \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-portkey-api-key: $PORTKEY_API_KEY" \
  -H "x-portkey-virtual-key: $PORTKEY_PROVIDER_VIRTUAL_KEY" \
```

```py Python
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(
  api_key = "PORTKEY_API_KEY",
  virtual_key = "PROVIDER_VIRTUAL_KEY"
)
```

```ts JavaScript
import Portkey from 'portkey-ai';

const portkey = new Portkey({
  apiKey: 'PORTKEY_API_KEY',
  virtualKey: 'PROVIDER_VIRTUAL_KEY'
});
```
</CodeGroup>
<Note>
Creating virtual keys lets you:
- Manage all credentials in one place
- Rotate between different provider keys
- Set custom budget limits & rate limits per key
</Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Option 2. Direct Provider Auth">
Set the provider name from one of Portkey's 40+ supported providers list and use your provider credentials directly with each request.

<CodeGroup>
```sh cURL
curl https://api.portkey.ai/v1/rerank \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-portkey-api-key: $PORTKEY_API_KEY" \
  -H "x-portkey-provider: cohere" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $COHERE_API_KEY" \
```
```py Python
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(
  api_key = "PORTKEY_API_KEY",
  provider = "cohere",
  Authorization = "Bearer COHERE_API_KEY"
)
```
```ts JavaScript
import Portkey from 'portkey-ai';

const portkey = new Portkey({
  apiKey: 'PORTKEY_API_KEY',
  provider: "cohere",
  Authorization: "Bearer COHERE_API_KEY"
});
```
</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Option 3. Custom Hosted Endpoint">

Route to your privately hosted model endpoints.
- Choose a compatible provider type (e.g., `openai`, `cohere`)
- Provide your endpoint URL with `customHost`
- Include `Authentication` if needed

<CodeGroup>

```sh cURL
curl https://api.portkey.ai/v1/rerank \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-portkey-api-key: $PORTKEY_API_KEY" \
  -H "x-portkey-provider: cohere" \
  -H "x-portkey-custom-host: https://182.145.24.5:8080/v1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $COHERE_API_KEY" \
```

```py Python
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(
  api_key = "PORTKEY_API_KEY",
  provider = "cohere",
  custom_host = "https://182.145.24.5:8080/v1",
  Authorization = "Bearer COHERE_API_KEY"
)
```

```ts JavaScript
import Portkey from 'portkey-ai';

const portkey = new Portkey({
  apiKey: 'PORTKEY_API_KEY',
  provider: "cohere",
  customHost: "https://182.145.24.5:8080/v1",
  Authorization: "Bearer COHERE_API_KEY"
});
```

## 3. Make Requests

<Tabs>
<Tab title="cURL">
Construct your request URL:
1. Portkey Gateway base URL remains same: `https://api.portkey.ai/v1`
2. Append your custom endpoint at the end of the URL: `https://api.portkey.ai/v1/{provider-endpoint}`

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.portkey.ai/v1/rerank \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --header 'x-portkey-api-key: $PORTKEY_API_KEY' \
     --header 'x-portkey-virtual-key: $COHERE_VIRTUAL_KEY' \
     --data '{
       "model": "rerank-english-v2.0",
       "query": "What is machine learning?",
       "documents": [
         "Machine learning is a branch of AI focused on building systems that learn from data.",
         "Data science involves analyzing and interpreting complex data sets."
       ]
     }'
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Python SDK">
<Info>The SDK supports the `POST` method currently.</Info>
1. Instantiate your Portkey client
2. Use the `.post(url, requestParams)` method to make requests:

```python
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(
    api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    virtual_key="PROVIDER_VIRTUAL_KEY"
)

response = portkey.post(
    '/rerank',
    model="rerank-english-v2.0",
    query="What is machine learning?",
    documents=[
        "Machine learning is a branch of AI focused on building systems that learn from data.",
        "Data science involves analyzing and interpreting complex data sets."
    ]
)
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="NodeJS SDK">
<Info>The SDK supports the `POST` method currently.</Info>
1. Instantiate your Portkey client
2. Use the `.post(url, requestParams)` method to make requests:

```javascript
import Portkey from 'portkey-ai';

const portkey = new Portkey({
    apiKey: "PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    virtualKey: "PROVIDER_VIRTUAL_KEY"
});

const response = await portkey.post('/rerank', {
    model: "rerank-english-v2.0",
    query: "What is machine learning?",
    documents: [
        "Machine learning is a branch of AI focused on building systems that learn from data.",
        "Data science involves analyzing and interpreting complex data sets."
    ]
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## End-to-end Example

<Accordion title="Cohere Rerank Integration">

A complete example showing document reranking with Cohere:

```python
from portkey_ai import Portkey

portkey = Portkey(
    api_key="PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    virtual_key="COHERE_VIRTUAL_KEY"
)

response = portkey.post(
    '/rerank',
    return_documents=False,
    max_chunks_per_doc=10,
    model="rerank-english-v2.0",
    query="What is the capital of the United States?",
    documents=[
        "Carson City is the capital city of the American state of Nevada.",
        "Washington, D.C. is the capital of the United States.",
        "Capital punishment has existed in the United States since before its founding."
    ]
)
```
</Accordion>

# Caveats & Considerations

- Response objects are returned exactly as received from the provider, without Portkey transformations
- REST API supports all HTTP methods
- SDK currently supports `POST` only (more methods coming soon)
- There are no limitations on which provider endpoints can be proxied
- All requests are logged and monitored through your Portkey dashboard
