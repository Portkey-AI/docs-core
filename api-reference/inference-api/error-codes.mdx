Portkey uses conventional response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided. Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Portkeyâ€™s servers (these are rare).


 ## Common Errors
 During request processing, you may encounter error codes from either Portkey or the LLM provider:

 | Status Code | Description | Source |
 |------------|-------------|---------|
 | `408` | Request timed out | Portkey OR Provider |
 | `412` | Budget exhausted | Portkey OR Provider |
 | `429` | Request rate limited | Portkey OR Provider |
 | `446` | Guardrail checks failed (request denied) | Portkey  |
 | `246` | Guardrail checks failed (request successful) | Portkey  |

<Note>
 Provider-specific error codes are passed through by Portkey. For debugging these errors, refer to our [Error Library](https://portkey.ai/error-library).
