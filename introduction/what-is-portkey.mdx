### FAQs

  <Accordion title="Will Portkey increase the latency of my API requests?">
    Portkey is hosted on edge workers throughout the world, ensuring minimal latency. Our benchmarks estimate a total latency addition between 20-40ms compared to direct API calls. This slight increase is often offset by the benefits of our caching and routing optimizations.
