## 1\. Get your Portkey API Key

[Create](https://app.portkey.ai/signup) or [log in](https://app.portkey.ai/login) to your Portkey account. Grab your account's API key from the "Settings" page.

</Frame>

Based on your access level, you might see the relevant permissions on the API key modal - tick the ones you'd like, name your API key, and save it.

## 2\. Integrate Portkey

Portkey offers a variety of integration options, including SDKs, REST APIs, and native connections with platforms like OpenAI, Langchain, and LlamaIndex, among others.

### Through the OpenAI SDK

If you're using the **OpenAI SDK**, import the Portkey SDK and configure it within your OpenAI client object:

### Portkey SDK

You can also use the **Portkey SDK / REST APIs** directly to make the chat completion calls. This is a more versatile way to make LLM calls across any provider:

Once, the integration is ready, you can view the requests reflect on your Portkey dashboard.
