        <p>Hi John,</p>
        <p>I noticed YMU's been expanding its roster of A-list talent lately – congrats on that growth. Having worked event security for talent agencies before, I know how challenging it can be coordinating reliable security teams, especially on short notice.</p>
        <p>We've built something I think you'll find interesting – an on-demand security platform that's already being used by several major talent agencies.</p>

This cookbook shows you how to build an AI-powered system that:
- **Researches prospects in real-time** using up-to-date web data
- **Crafts personalized emails** based on prospect-specific insights
- **Self-evaluates and improves** its output before sending
- **Scales to thousands of prospects** at a fraction of the usual cost

## Multi-Agent Architecture

    style E font-size:14px
```

Our system combines three specialized AI models:

1. **Orchestrator (Claude 3.7)**: Generates research queries, drafts emails, and refines based on feedback
2. **Researcher (Perplexity)**: Gathers real-time web information about prospects and companies
3. **Evaluator (OpenAI)**: Reviews email quality, providing scores and improvement suggestions

This architecture delivers superior results because:
- Each model handles tasks it excels at
- The system includes built-in quality control
- Cost efficiency through right-sized models and targeted research

## Creating the Prompt Templates

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Orchestrator Template">
  
  ### What You'll Create

  The Orchestrator template handles three different roles depending on which "mode" is activated:
  1. **Research Query Generator**: Creates targeted questions for the researcher
  2. **Email Drafter**: Uses research findings to write personalized outreach
  3. **Email Refiner**: Incorporates evaluator feedback to improve the email

  ### Variables You'll Need

  | Variable | Purpose | Example |
  |----------|---------|---------|
  | `our_offering` | Your product/service description | "Umbrella Corp offers 'Uber for personal protection'..." |
  | `company_name` | Prospect's company | "YMU Talent Agency" |
  | `company_industry` | Industry sector | "Elite Talent Management" |
  | `target_person_name` | Contact name | "John Wick" |
  | `target_person_designation` | Contact's role | "Event Organizer" |
  | `requirement_gathering_mode` | Activates research query mode | "TRUE" or "" (empty) |
  | `research_mode` | Activates email drafting mode | "TRUE" or "" (empty) |
  | `evaluator_mode` | Activates email refinement mode | "TRUE" or "" (empty) |
  | `researcher_output` | Data from the researcher | (JSON response from research) |
  | `evaluator_output` | Feedback from evaluator | (JSON with score and comments) |


  ### Step-by-Step Setup

  1. **Create template** in [prompt.new](https://prompt.new/) with **Claude 3.7 Sonnet**

    <video autoPlay muted loop playsInline className="w-full aspect-video" src="/guides/prompts/ultimate-ai-sdr/new-prompt.mp4" />

  2. **Add core partials**:

Let's create reusable components that define our SDR's core instructions and persona. These are added as **Prompt Partials** - reusable blocks that can be inserted in any template.
  <AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Core Agent Instructions Partial">
  You are the ultimate sales representative from Umbrella Corporation. Your job is to:
  1. Understand the company and target person
  2. Write research queries to learn more about them
  3. Use research findings to write the ultimate opener email
  4. Send to evaluator for improvements
  5. Write final email based on feedback
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="SDR Persona Partial">
  Your name is Ilya:
  - You acutely understand the exact requirements your target person and their company has
  - You write short, to the point emails that feel like a friend sending a text to you
  - At the same time, you understand the importance of coming across as a thorough professional
  - You have yourself been on both ends - when you needed private security and when you yourself were a private security professional
  </Accordion>
  </AccordionGroup>

  We'll insert both partials into the template's system role like this:

  <Frame>
    <img src="/guides/prompts/ultimate-ai-sdr/main-agent-system.png" />
  </Frame>

  3. **Add product offering**:

  Next, we'll add a section that will receive your company's offering details from a variable:

  <Frame>
    <img src="/guides/prompts/ultimate-ai-sdr/our-offerings.png" />
  </Frame>

  We'll send this variable's content at runtime.

  4. **Add Prospect Information Section**:

  Now let's add a section that will receive the prospect information variables:

  <Frame>
    <img src="/guides/prompts/ultimate-ai-sdr/variables.png" />
  </Frame>

  We'll send these values at runtime as well.

  5. **Create Agent-Specific Sections with Conditional Logic**:

This is where the magic happens! We'll add three "conditional sections" that only appear when a specific mode is activated:

  *A. Research Query Generation Mode:*
  Here, we'll explain how the research query should be generated.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/guides/prompts/ultimate-ai-sdr/requirement-gathering.png" />
  </Frame>

  At this stage, we can send a request to the researcher get the research output back.

  *B. Email Drafting Mode (add this section next):*
  
  Once we have the research output, we can create the first email, and add the following to a new user role in the prompt template:
  <Frame>
    <img src="/guides/prompts/ultimate-ai-sdr/researcher-main-agent.png" />
  </Frame>

  We'll take this email and send it to the evaluator, which will send back a JSON with two keys: "score" and "comment".

  *C. Email Refinement Mode (add this final section):*

  With the Evaluator's output, we'll now create the final email.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/guides/prompts/ultimate-ai-sdr/evaluator-main-agent.png" />
  </Frame>

    <Tip>
  **The Power of Conditional Variables**

  This approach with `{{#variable_name}}` syntax lets you use a single template for three different purposes. When you set `requirement_gathering_mode` to "TRUE", only that section appears. When you set it to empty and instead set `research_mode` to "TRUE", the email drafting section appears instead. This keeps your templates DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
  </Tip>

  ### Complete Template Overview

  When finished, your template should have:
  1. Core instruction and persona partials at the top
  2. Company offering section
  3. Prospect information section
  4. Three conditional sections for different modes

  This single template will now handle all three stages of the orchestrator's job, activated by different variables in your code.
</Tab>
  
<Tab title="Researcher Template">

  ### What You'll Create
  
  The Researcher template powers the real-time web research capabilities of your AI SDR system.

  ### Variables

  | Inputt | Description | Source/Destination |
  |--------------|-------------|-------------------|
  | `requirement_gathering_output` | Research queries | Received from Orchestrator |

  ### Setup Steps

  1. Create a new prompt template with **Perplexity Sonar Pro** as the model

  2. Add researcher instructions:

  Add these system instructions that define the researcher's role:

  <Accordion title="Researcher instructions">
  You are a world-class researcher who, when given key info about a company, its industry, and the target person, helps your handler write the ultimate sales email by gathering the critical insights about them from the internet.

  In scenarios where you do not find much info about the company in question, you also try to extrapolate the key information about this company that helps with writing the ultimate opener email.
  </Accordion>

  Your completed template should look like this:

  <Frame>
    <img src="/guides/prompts/ultimate-ai-sdr/researcher.png" alt="Researcher template configuration" />
  </Frame>

<Accordion title="Researcher output">
YMU Group is a global talent management agency founded in 1984 and based in London[1]. It offers full-service talent management, including representation for entertainers, athletes, musicians, and literary figures[1]. The company works with high-profile clients like Simon Cowell, Graham Norton, Claudia Winkleman, Nicole Scherzinger, Stacey Solomon, and Ant and Dec[7].

In 2023, YMU reported a pre-tax loss of £32 million on revenue of £42.4 million[7]. The company was sold in March 2024 for £60 million to Permira Credit[7].

YMU appears to focus on talent representation and career management rather than event organization. The search results don't mention John Wick or provide details about specific events, security practices, or budgets.

For writing a sales email, you might focus on YMU's role as a major talent agency representing top celebrities. Their need for security services likely relates to protecting high-profile clients rather than large-scale event management. You could highlight how your security offerings could benefit their roster of celebrity talent in various professional and personal settings.

Without more specific information, it's best to keep the email fairly general, focusing on your company's experience protecting high-profile individuals and how that aligns with YMU's client base. You might also mention your ability to provide flexible, on-demand security staffing to meet the changing needs of busy entertainment professionals.
</Accordion>
</Tab>
  
<Tab title="Evaluator Template">

  ### What You'll Create
  
  The Evaluator template provides quality control for your AI SDR system.

  ### Variables

  | Input | Description | Source/Destination |
  |--------------|-------------|-------------------|
  | `work_history` | Research queries + findings + email draft | Received from previous steps |


  ### Setup Steps

  1. Create a template with **OpenAI o3-mini** as the model

  2. Add evaluator instructions:

  Add these system instructions that define the evaluator's role:

  <Accordion title="Evaluator instructions">
  You are the critical part of an AI SDR agent that helps write opening sales email to a given prospect at a given company. Your key job is look at everything provided to you: The SDR's job to be done, the SDR's persona, the company and the target person in question, the research output, and send back a JSON with two keys: "score" and "comment".

  The actual JSON object will be: `{"score":<integer out of 10>, "comment":"<qualitative feedback about the email given to you>"}`

  Based on your feedback, the agent will rework the email and then send it to the prospect.
  </Accordion>

  Your completed template should look like this:

  <Frame>
    <img src="/guides/prompts/ultimate-ai-sdr/evaluator.png" />
  </Frame>

    Evaluator is like an AI sales manager reviewing drafts before they go out - ensuring consistent quality at scale.

    <Accordion title="Evaluator output">
    ```json
    {"score": 7, "comment": "The research summary does a good job of contextualizing YMU as a leading talent agency with high-profile clients, emphasizing the need for security services tailored to the protection of celebrities. It provides a solid foundation for a targeted email by suggesting a focus on flexible, on-demand security staffing. However, the information is somewhat generic, lacking specifics that could create a more compelling and personalized pitch. The email would benefit from slightly more emphasis on addressing potential security challenges or pain points unique to managing high-profile talent, even if inferred, to make the value proposition sharper."}

    Hi John,

    I noticed YMU's been expanding its roster of A-list talent lately – congrats on that growth. Having worked event security for talent agencies before, I know how challenging it can be coordinating reliable security teams, especially on short notice.

    We've built something I think you'll find interesting – an on-demand security platform that's already being used by several major talent agencies. Think of it like having an elite security team in your pocket, available within hours.
