Protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) has become a critical requirement for enterprises deploying AI applications. With regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA imposing strict penalties for data breaches, organizations need robust mechanisms to prevent PII from being exposed through AI systems. This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough of implementing PII protection using Portkey's guardrail capabilities.

### Why PII Guardrails Matter for Your AI Applications

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meet requirements for GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and other data protection regulations
- **Data Breach Prevention**: Stop sensitive information from leaking through AI responses
- **Customer Trust**: Demonstrate commitment to privacy and data protection
- **Cost Optimization**: Avoid regulatory fines and reputational damage
- **Operational Excellence**: Automate PII detection and redaction at scale

## Overview of Portkey's PII Protection Options

Portkey offers multiple approaches to PII protection:

### 1. **Portkey Native PII Detection**
- Comprehensive PII detection using advanced ML models
- Detects and redacts: names, emails, phones, addresses, SSNs, credit cards, IP addresses
- Simple configuration with immediate results
- Available on Production and Enterprise plans

### 2. **AWS Bedrock Guardrails Integration**
- Enterprise-grade PII detection from AWS
- Supports custom PII patterns via regex
- Currently focuses on SSN redaction by default

## How PII Transformation Works

When PII is detected in a request, Portkey transforms it before sending to the LLM:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product/Guardrails/pii-guardrails-logs.png" alt="Shows original request with PII and transformed request with placeholders" />
</Frame>

The transformation process:
- **Original**: Contains actual PII like names, emails, SSNs
- **Final (Transformed)**: PII replaced with numbered placeholders
- **Status**: Shows if transformation occurred

## Setting Up Portkey's Native PII Detection

### Step 1: Create a PII Detection Guardrail

1. Navigate to **Guardrails** → **Create**
2. Search for "Detect PII" under PRO guardrails
3. Select PII categories to detect:
   - **Phone Numbers**: Mobile and landline numbers
   - **Email Addresses**: Personal and corporate emails
   - **Location Information**: Addresses, cities, coordinates
   - **IP Addresses**: IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
   - **Social Security Numbers**: US SSN format
   - **Names**: First names, last names, full names
   - **Credit Card Information**: Card numbers

### Step 2: Enable PII Redaction

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/product/Guardrails/pii-redaction.png" />
</Frame>

Toggle the **Redact PII** option to automatically replace detected PII with placeholders.

### Step 3: Configure Guardrail Actions

Set up how your guardrail should behave:
- **Async**: Run checks without blocking (default: TRUE)
- **Deny**: Block requests with PII (default: FALSE)
- **On Success/Failure**: Send feedback for monitoring

### Step 4: Add to Config and Use

Once you save your guardrail, you'll get a Guardrail ID. Add it to your config:

```json
{
  "input_guardrails": ["gr-pii-detection-xxx"]
}
```

<Note>
The examples below demonstrate **input guardrails only**. You can also apply PII detection to outputs by adding guardrails to `output_guardrails`.
</Note>

| **Instance Tracking** | ✅ Each PII instance tracked separately | ✅ Same placeholder for same type |
| **Names** | `[NAME_X]` | `{NAME}` |
| **Emails** | `[EMAIL_ADDRESS_X]` | `{EMAIL}` |
| **Phone Numbers** | `[PHONE_NUMBER_X]` | `{PHONE}` |
| **SSN** | `[SSN_X]` | `{US_SOCIAL_SECURITY_NUMBER}{SSN_REGEX}` |
| **Addresses** | `[LOCATION_ADDRESS_X]` | `{ADDRESS}` |
| **Credit Cards** | `[CREDIT_CARD_X]` | `{CREDIT_DEBIT_CARD_NUMBER}` |
| **IP Addresses** | `[IP_ADDRESS_X]` | `{IP_ADDRESS}` |

### When to Use Which?

**Choose Portkey Native PII Detection when**:
- You need to track individual PII instances
- You want numbered placeholders for better context
- You prefer simple, consistent placeholder format
- You need quick setup without AWS configuration

**Choose AWS Bedrock when**:
- You're already using AWS infrastructure
- You need specific US-format detection (US_BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER)
- You want dual detection patterns (e.g., SSN + regex)
- You need to comply with AWS security standards

## Monitoring PII Detection

### Viewing Results in Portkey Logs

Navigate to your Portkey logs to see:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/guardrails/pii-transformation-logs.png" alt="Shows the transformation view in Portkey logs" />
</Frame>

1. **Original Request**: What the user sent
2. **Final (Transformed)**: What was sent to the LLM
3. **Guardrail Status**: Shows if PII detection succeeded
4. **Detected Entities**: List of all PII found

Example log entry:
```
Guardrails
✓ pii - 1 successful
No PII (when no PII detected)
```

### Understanding Response Codes

- **200**: Request successful (PII redacted if found)
- **246**: PII detected but request continued (Deny = false)
- **446**: Request blocked due to PII (Deny = true)
