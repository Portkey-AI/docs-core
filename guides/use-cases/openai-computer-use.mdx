description: "Leverage Portkey with OpenAI's Computer Use tool for automated browser interactions with enterprise-grade observability and controls"
---

OpenAI's Computer Use tool enables AI to interact with computer interfaces through a continuous loop of actions and screenshots, allowing for automated web browsing, form filling, data extraction, and other complex UI-based tasks. However, deploying this capability in production environments comes with challenges around monitoring, cost control, and reliability.

This cookbook demonstrates how to integrate Portkey with OpenAI's Computer Use to build production-ready automation solutions with enterprise-grade controls. You'll learn how to:

- Set up a Portkey client to handle Computer Use API calls
- Build a complete Playwright-based browser automation solution
- Implement the continuous action-screenshot loop required by Computer Use
- Enhance your application with Portkey's enterprise features

## Why Use Portkey with Computer Use?

Portkey adds several critical capabilities when working with OpenAI's Computer Use:

- **Unified API Gateway**: Seamlessly switch between models or providers while maintaining the same implementation
- **Cost Tracking & Budget Controls**: Monitor usage costs in real-time and set spending limits to prevent unexpected bills
- **Detailed Analytics**: View 40+ metrics for each interaction including token usage, response times, and error rates
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Implement retries, fallbacks, and timeouts to make your automation more resilient
- **Secure API Key Management**: Store API credentials securely using Portkey's Virtual Keys
- **Usage Attribution**: Track usage across teams, departments, or projects for proper cost allocation



OpenAI's Computer Use tool enables AI to interact with computer interfaces through a continuous loop of actions and screenshots. Portkey's integration with this capability makes it production-ready with enterprise features like observability, reliability, and governance controls.

## Prerequisites

- Portkey account with API key ([sign up here](https://app.portkey.ai))
- OpenAI API key stored in Portkey as a [Virtual Key](/product/ai-gateway/virtual-keys)
- Playwright for browser automation

<Note>
This guide focuses on Playwright integration, but Portkey works equally well with other environments supported by Computer Use, such as Docker-based VMs or other automation frameworks.
</Note>

## Integration Steps

### 1. Install & Import Required Libraries

```
pip install portkey-ai playwright
```

```python
import time
import base64
from portkey_ai import Portkey  # Import Portkey instead of OpenAI
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
```

<Note>
    The first time you run this, if you haven't used Playwright before, you will be prompted to install dependencies. Execute the command suggested, which will depend on your OS.
</Note>

### 2. Initialize Portkey Client

Replace the standard OpenAI client with Portkey's client, configuring it with your Portkey API key and OpenAI virtual key:

```python
client = Portkey(
    api_key="YOUR_PORTKEY_API_KEY",
    virtual_key="YOUR_OPENAI_VIRTUAL_KEY",  # Virtual key containing your OpenAI credentials
)
```

### 3. Set Up Your Browser Environment

```python
with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(
        headless=False,
        chromium_sandbox=True,
        env={},
        args=[
            "--disable-extensions",
            "--disable-file-system"
        ]
    )
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.set_viewport_size({"width": 1024, "height": 768})
    page.goto("https://bing.com")  # Starting URL

    page.wait_for_timeout(2000)  # Wait for page to load
```

### 4. Create Helper Functions for Actions and Screenshots

```python
def handle_model_action(page, action):
    """Execute computer actions on the Playwright page."""
    action_type = action.type

    try:
        match action_type:
            case "click":
                x, y = action.x, action.y
                button = action.button
                print(f"Action: click at ({x}, {y}) with button '{button}'")
                if button != "left" and button != "right":
                    button = "left"
                page.mouse.click(x, y, button=button)

            case "scroll":
                x, y = action.x, action.y
                scroll_x, scroll_y = action.scroll_x, action.scroll_y
                print(f"Action: scroll at ({x}, {y}) with offsets ({scroll_x}, {scroll_y})")
                page.mouse.move(x, y)
                page.evaluate(f"window.scrollBy({scroll_x}, {scroll_y})")

            case "keypress":
                keys = action.keys
                for k in keys:
                    print(f"Action: keypress '{k}'")
                    if k.lower() == "enter":
                        page.keyboard.press("Enter")
                    elif k.lower() == "space":
                        page.keyboard.press(" ")
                    else:
                        page.keyboard.press(k)

            case "type":
                text = action.text
                print(f"Action: type text: {text}")
                page.keyboard.type(text)

            case "wait":
                print(f"Action: wait")
                time.sleep(2)

            case "screenshot":
                print(f"Action: screenshot")
                # Nothing to do as screenshot is taken at each turn

            case _:
                print(f"Unrecognized action: {action}")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error handling action {action}: {e}")


def get_screenshot(page):
    """Take a screenshot using Playwright."""
    return page.screenshot()
```

### 5. Implement the Computer Use Loop

```python
def computer_use_loop(instance, response):
    """Run the loop that executes computer actions until no more 'computer_call' is found."""
    while True:
        computer_calls = [item for item in response.output if item.type == "computer_call"]
        if not computer_calls:
            print("No computer call found. Output from model:")
            for item in response.output:
                print(item)
            break  # Exit when no computer calls are issued.

        # We expect at most one computer call per response.
        computer_call = computer_calls[0]
        last_call_id = computer_call.call_id
        action = computer_call.action

        # Execute the action
        handle_model_action(instance, action)
        time.sleep(1)  # Allow time for changes to take effect.

        # Take a screenshot after the action
        screenshot_bytes = get_screenshot(instance)
        screenshot_base64 = base64.b64encode(screenshot_bytes).decode("utf-8")

        # Send the screenshot back as a computer_call_output
        response = client.responses.create(
            model="computer-use-preview",
            previous_response_id=response.id,
            tools=[
                {
                    "type": "computer_use_preview",
                    "display_width": 1024,
                    "display_height": 768,
                    "environment": "browser"
                }
            ],
            input=[
                {
                    "call_id": last_call_id,
                    "type": "computer_call_output",
                    "output": {
                        "type": "input_image",
                        "image_url": f"data:image/png;base64,{screenshot_base64}"
                    }
                }
            ],
            truncation="auto"
        )

    return response
```

### 6. Start the Computer Use Session

```python
# Initialize the first request
initial_response = client.responses.create(
    model="computer-use-preview",
    tools=[{
        "type": "computer_use_preview",
        "display_width": 1024,
        "display_height": 768,
        "environment": "browser"
    }],
    input=[
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": [
            {
              "type": "input_text",
              "text": "Check the latest OpenAI news on bing.com."
            }
          ]
        }
    ],
    reasoning={
        "summary": "concise",
    },
    truncation="auto"
)

# Start the computer use loop
final_response = computer_use_loop(page, initial_response)
```

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/integrations/observability.png" width="600"/>
</Frame>

### 2. Budget Control & Governance
Set spending limits, track costs by department, and implement rate limiting to prevent unexpected usage spikes.

### 3. Reliability Features
Add fallbacks, automatic retries, and timeouts to make your Computer Use applications more robust in production environments.

### 4. Secure API Key Management
Store your OpenAI API keys securely using Portkey's Virtual Keys instead of exposing them directly in your code.
