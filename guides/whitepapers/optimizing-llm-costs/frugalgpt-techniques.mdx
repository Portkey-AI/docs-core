title: '3. FrugalGPT Techniques for Cost Optimization'
description: '' 
---
The FrugalGPT framework introduces three key techniques for reducing LLM inference costs while maintaining or even improving performance. Let's explore each of these in detail.
## 3.1 Prompt Adaptation
Prompt adaptation is a key technique in the FrugalGPT framework for reducing LLM inference costs while maintaining performance. It involves crafting concise, optimized prompts to minimize token usage and processing costs.

## Key Strategies

1. **Clear and concise instructions**: Eliminate unnecessary words or context that don't contribute to the desired output.

2. **Use of delimiters**: Clearly separate different parts of the prompt (e.g., context, instructions, input) using delimiters like "###" or "---".

3. **Structured prompts**: Organize information in a logical, easy-to-process format for the model.

4. **Iterative refinement**: Continuously test and refine prompts to achieve the desired output with minimal token usage.

## Example

Here's an example of prompt adaptation:

```
Before:
Please analyze the following customer review and provide a summary of the main points, including any positive or negative aspects mentioned, and suggest how the company could improve based on this feedback. Here's the review: [long customer review text]

After:
Summarize key points from this review:
Positive:
Negative:
Improvement suggestions:
###
[concise customer review text]
```

By adapting prompts in this way, you can significantly reduce token usage while still obtaining high-quality outputs from the model.

## 3.2 LLM Approximation
LLM approximation is a technique in the FrugalGPT framework that involves using caches and model fine-tuning to avoid repeated queries to expensive models. This approach can lead to substantial cost savings, especially for frequently asked questions or similar queries.

## Key Strategies

1. **Response caching**: Store responses to common queries for quick retrieval.

2. **Semantic caching**: Use similarity measures to return cached responses for semantically similar queries.

3. **Fine-tuning smaller models**: Train smaller, task-specific models on the outputs of larger models.

## Implementation Example

Here's a basic example of implementing semantic caching:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

def get_embeddings(texts):
    # Implementation details...

cache = {}  # Simple in-memory cache

def semantic_cache_query(query):
    query_embedding = get_embeddings([query])[0]
    for cached_query, response in cache.items():
        cached_embedding = get_embeddings([cached_query])[0]
        similarity = cosine_similarity([query_embedding], [cached_embedding])[0][0]
        if similarity > 0.95:  # Adjust threshold as needed
            return response
    return None  # No similar query found in cache

# Usage
response = semantic_cache_query("What's the weather like today?")
if response is None:
    # Query the expensive LLM and cache the result
    response = expensive_llm_query("What's the weather like today?")
    cache["What's the weather like today?"] = response
print(response)
```
## 3.3 LLM Cascade
This approach can lead to significant cost savings, especially for applications with repetitive queries or similar user inputs.


The LLM cascade technique involves dynamically selecting the optimal set of LLMs to query based on the input. This approach leverages the strengths of different models while managing costs effectively.

## Key Components

1. **Task classifier**: Determines the complexity and nature of the input query.

2. **Model selector**: Chooses the appropriate model(s) based on the task classification.

3. **Confidence evaluator**: Assesses the confidence of each model's output.

4. **Escalation logic**: Decides whether to query a more powerful (and expensive) model based on confidence thresholds.

## Implementation Example

Here's a basic example of implementing an LLM cascade:

```python
def classify_task(query):
    # Implement task classification logic
    pass

def select_model(task_type):
    # Choose appropriate model based on task type
    pass

def evaluate_confidence(model_output):
    # Implement confidence evaluation logic
    pass

def llm_cascade(query):
    task_type = classify_task(query)
    selected_model = select_model(task_type)
    response = selected_model.generate(query)
    confidence = evaluate_confidence(response)
    
    if confidence < CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD:
        # Escalate to more powerful model
        advanced_model = select_advanced_model(task_type)
        response = advanced_model.generate(query)
    
    return response

# Usage
result = llm_cascade("Explain quantum computing in simple terms")
print(result)
```

By implementing an LLM cascade, organizations can optimize their use of different models, ensuring that expensive, high-performance models are only used when necessary.
